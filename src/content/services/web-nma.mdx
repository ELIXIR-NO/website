## Introduction

WEBnma is a tool to predict flexibility in protein structures.
This tool is a part of the ELIXIR Norway infrastructure services.
The WEBnma is a consortium member of the Protein Data
Bank in Europe—Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB).

## About this service

WEBnma, part of the ELIXIR Norway infrastructure services,
predicts flexibility in protein structures. As a consortium member
of the Protein Data Bank in Europe – Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB),
WEBnma provides tools for analyzing and visualizing protein dynamics, helping researchers understand the structural flexibility and function of proteins.

## Why use this service

WEBnma is essential for structural biologists,
bioinformaticians, and researchers studying protein dynamics.
It offers advanced tools for predicting and visualizing
protein flexibility, aiding in the understanding of protein
function and interaction. The platform’s integration with
PDBe-KB ensures access to high-quality data and resources.
