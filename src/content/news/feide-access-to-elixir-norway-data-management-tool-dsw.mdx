**It is now possible to log on to ELIXIR Norway Data Stewardship Wizard, the data management planning tool for smart generation of DMPs using FEIDE**

We have enabled access to the [ELIXIR Norway Data Stewardship Wizard](https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org/) using FEIDE login credentials. Users that has not yet registered their FEIDE-ID in the ELIXIR-AAI service need to do so first in order to use this login functionality. A detailed description on how to can be found [here](https://elixir-europe.org/register). Please contact the [Norwegian ELIXIR Helpdesk](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no) if you have any questions.

UPDATE (2022-03-31): We have streamlined access via FEIDE further, and you will now be directly forwarded to the FEIDE login.
