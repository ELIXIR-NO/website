The PeoplePulse project underscores ELIXIR's commitment to nurturing a skilled, diverse and collaborative community for staff. 
By addressing key aspects like onboarding, role definition, ELITMa training, and equipping ELIXIR Node staff with organisation and management skills and training on impact assessment, ELIXIR aims to strengthen its internal capabilities as well as significantly advance bioinformatics research and innovation.
This project focuses on these critical aspects of people development:

* Improving the onboarding process – the gateway for people new to the ELIXIR network
* Delineating roles that cater for a spectrum of expertise
* Developing innovative training concepts tailored to the challenges of ELIXIR
* Sharing success stories and best practices from people development initiatives

The Norwegian node is involved in the development of training on how to assess both environmental impact and the impact of the nodes.
