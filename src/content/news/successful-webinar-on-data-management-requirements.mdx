**On February 5th [Korbinian Bösl](https://www4.uib.no/finn-ansatte/Korbinian.B%C3%B6sl) (ELIXIR Norway, BioMedData & Centre for Digital Life Norway) gave a webinar with the topic Data Management requirements**

Close to research project funding deadlines the timing of this webinar was good as there were almost 60 participants, and many more that have asked for access to the course material. The course material is available [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4506279).

ELIXIR Norway will continue to organise training events on data management at the Norwegian Universities. Due to current restrictions, many of these events will be online. All training events will be announced on the elixir.no websites.
