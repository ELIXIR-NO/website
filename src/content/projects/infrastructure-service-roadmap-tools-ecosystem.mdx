The ELIXIR Tools Platform Ecosystem is a diverse and open initiative focused on the metadata
exchange across registries and repositories. Its goal is to facilitate coordination among them,
enhance interoperability, reduce mismatching information, promote good practices for resources
enabling community curation and contribute towards the sustainability of each of its components
over time. Considering the open nature of the Ecosystem, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to
guarantee a transparent and fair process for engaging and disengaging community-driven services
and platforms within ELIXIR and beyond to the Tools Platform Ecosystem.

In this project, ELIXIR Norway contributed to the guidelines and procedures for the prospective inclusion of new
registries and other resources into the Ecosystem
