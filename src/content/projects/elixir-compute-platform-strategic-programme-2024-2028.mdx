European regulation on health data processing is evolving, computing capacity in national clouds is increasing and international standards are improving interoperability between the compute environments.
Such capabilities are also increasingly important to service the growing volumes of biodiversity, food security and pathogen data which comprise complex data types and must be linked to climate data resources. Also, supercomputer investments - especially EuroHPC - provide completely new kinds of computing capacities for researchers across these domains.
The Norwegian effort is involved in WP 2: Advanced Service Access Control, defining best practices for data brokering.
