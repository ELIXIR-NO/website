Convened by [BioData.pt](https://biodata.pt), the first workshop of the ELIXIR-funded
Staff Exchange Project entitled “Empowering ELIXIR Nodes to measure and communicate
their performance and impact” took place on **30 January 2020, in Lisbon (Portugal)**.

A total of 17 participants, including Portuguese and international stakeholders
from Norway, Italy, Spain and Czech Republic, met to build their capacity in
performance and impact assessment of research infrastructures in the life sciences.
After brief presentations introducing the topic, participants took part in
interactive sessions built around the methodology being developed by
the RI-PATHS project consortium.

This allowed non-specialists in the field of impact evaluation to get started with
performance and impact assessment, thereby empowering them to apply this approach to
evaluate the performance and impact of their research infrastructure activities.

Two follow-up workshops are in the planning: to develop and refine the approach
with additional ELIXIR countries (in March 2020, convened by ELIXIR Italy) and
to test and showcase the approach (Bergen, in May 2020, convened by ELIXIR Norway).
