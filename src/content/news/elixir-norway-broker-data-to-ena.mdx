**ELIXIR Norway is pleased to announce that we launched a service to submit
data to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) on behalf of end-users
and Norwegian research institutions.**

In the process of making data FAIR it is recommended data is submitted
to proper public repositories or archives. The European Nucleotide Archive
(ENA) provides a comprehensive record of the worldâ€™s nucleotide sequencing
information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information
and functional annotation. Most scientific journals require sequence
data to be available in ENA prior to publication, and the research
funding bodies also have similar requirements.

ELIXIR Norway has now become a broker for ENA. The new service will
ease the submission of data to ENA for the end-users. At the moment
the brokering is done manually by trained Helpdesk personnel, but
we will provide tools that can directly transfer data from the NeLS
storage to ENA, given that the metadata required by ENA is available.

Currently, ELIXIR Norway is acting as a broker for the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet) as a partner in
[BioMedData](organization/biomeddata), a national research infrastructure
to promote FAIR data management with the life sciences.

If you are interested in using this service, please contact the
[ELIXIR Norway Helpdesk](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no).
