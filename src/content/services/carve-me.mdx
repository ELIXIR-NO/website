## Introduction

CarveMe is a phyton-based software tool for automated generation of genome-scale metabolic models. This tool enables genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction in phyton. By simple command lines you can build models from your model file, using a FASTA file or your DNA sequence. CarveMe predicts the uptake and secretion capabilities of an organism only from genetic evidence and can produce a simulation-ready model without gap-filling for any media. CarveMe also enables the generation of microbial community models from single species models. CarveME is an official service of ELIXIR Norway.
