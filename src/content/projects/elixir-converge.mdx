ELIXIR-CONVERGE is an EU-funded initiative aiming to standardize life science data management across Europe. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive data management toolkit designed to assist life scientists in handling their research data according to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). By making more research data publicly available, the project aims to provide scientists with the resources they need to gain new insights into societal challenges, such as food security and health in aging populations, and to stimulate innovation in biomedicine and biotechnology.

ELIXIR Norwayâ€™s Contributions to ELIXIR-CONVERGE:

ELIXIR Norway plays an essential role in the ELIXIR-CONVERGE project, actively participating in all its work packages. Specifically, ELIXIR Norway co-leads Work Package 3 (WP3), which focuses on developing a Common Data Management Toolkit. Additionally, ELIXIR Norway leads Demonstrator 3 in Work Package 5 (WP5), aimed at creating common data management plans for the marine metagenomics community. These efforts are closely aligned with the national BioMedData project, ensuring seamless integration and coordination at both national and international levels.
