Research Data Management (RDM) is crucial for implementing FAIR and Open Science principles. ELIXIR Platforms and Nodes have invested in RDM, resulting in valuable tools and resources. The RDM Community aims to bring together RDM professionals to coordinate ELIXIR's activities and develop its vision. The short-term objectives include creating a knowledge exchange forum, coordinating the RDM ecosystem, and focusing on RDM training and data brokering.

To achieve these goals, the DATAREX project will facilitate knowledge sharing, develop resources for RDM service providers, coordinate RDM training and content, and make recommendations for enhancing data brokering services. This project will empower RDM professionals and contribute to improving research data management practices.

The present study is participated in by 19 ELIXIR Nodes. For ELIXIR Belgium, Flora Dâ€™Anna and Bert Droesbeke are involved.
