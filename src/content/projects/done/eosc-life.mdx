The EOSC-Life project is a collaboration of 13 ESFRI Research infrastructures in the Health and Food domain to create an open collaborative digital space for life science in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). The project is coordinated by ELIXIR.

Life science research directly addresses key societal challenges and drives the bio-economy. To keep European Life Science at the forefront of global advances and to deepen our understanding of life and disease, the data, digital services and advanced facilities vital for life science research must be findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable (FAIR) across scientific disciplines and national boundaries. FAIR data and services improves reproducibility of biomedical research, drives new scientific discoveries and enables any researcher in Europe and across the world to access and use them.  

In EOSC-Life the research infrastructures will publish data from facilities and data resources in the EOSC and link these FAIR databases to open and reusable Tools and Workflows accessible to users via Europe’s national and international life-science clouds. EOSC-Life will also connect users across Europe to a single login authentication and resource authorisation system and develop data policies needed to preserve and deepen the trust given by research participants and patients volunteering their data and samples.

ELIXIR Belgium (VIB) is involved in the work package “**Tools Collaboratory: Deployment of life-science data integration and analysis workflows in EOSC**” (WP2). WP leads are Antonio Rosato (Instruct) and Jean-Karim Heriche (EuroBioImaging). For ELIXIR Belgium: Frederik Coppens. The Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ) and the Ghent University are also involved in the EOSC-Life project, both via EMBRC.
