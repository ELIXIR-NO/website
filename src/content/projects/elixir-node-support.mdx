This project provides the structure to share this extensive experience and institutional knowledge. 
It will provide tools and knowledge to empower Nodes to better measure their activities and environment, streamline approaches and enable communication.
In addition, it will complement tasks in ELIXIR-STEERS in strengthening and equipping ELIXIR Nodes and Node staff with key organisation, management and training skills and resources.

# Ambitions for the project:
* Node operations: Nodes have the operational capabilities to contribute to a European infrastructure for data
* National research and open science policy alignment: Nodes are aligned with national research priorities and open science policies
* Integrating Nodes with industry and innovation: Nodes are fundamental to national industry ecosystems and engage in EU-wide industry effort
* Demonstrating impact and supporting sustainability: Nodes are empowered and supported in their efforts towards long-term sustainability. 

Norway is co-leading this project and involved in the management, sustainability, and impact of the nodes.
