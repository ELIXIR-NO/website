**We are pleased to announce the first release of
[MarFun](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/databases/marfun/#/), a database
for marine fungi, and also an update of [MarRef](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/databases/marref/#/)
and [MarDB](https://mmp.sfb.uit.no/databases/mardb/).**

The first version of MarFun contains 21 manually curated genomes. MarRef
and MarDB have been updated to version four, which contains 945 and
12972 entries respectively. MarDB contains now more MAGs (Metagenome
Assembled Genomes) than WGSs (Whole Shotgun Sequenced) and SAGs
(Single Amplified Genomes) together, with 7053, 4902 and 1017 entries,
respectively. The quality of each genome is now provided using
the CheckM output completeness (%), contamination (%) and QS
(Quality Score = completeness - 5 x contamination).
