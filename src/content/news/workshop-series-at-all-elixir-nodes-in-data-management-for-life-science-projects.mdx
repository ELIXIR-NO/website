The topic is on how you can generate a data management plan for a research project that will meet the requirements of the funding organisations. You will use the ELIXIR Norway Data Steward Wizard to make a data management plan.

Course content:  
- Requirements from the funding bodies and legal requirements
- Licensing of data, biological material and software
- Information on national and local storage infrastructures
- Relevant deposition repositories (data archives)
- Hands-on training and assistance to generate a data management plan

Bring your own laptop and your research project if you have one. You will get the opportunity to set up a data management plan for your project using the ELIXIR Norway Data Steward Wizard (DSW) tool ([https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org](https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org)). DSW is more flexible and provides more domain specific templates than the easyDMP offered by Uninett/Sigma2.

### The intended audience

Researchers (PhD candidates, post-doctoral fellows, researchers, Associate Professor, professor) that are planning to submit a grant application for a research project.
