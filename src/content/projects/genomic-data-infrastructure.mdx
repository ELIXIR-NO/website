GDI project is establishing a federated, sustainable and secure infrastructure to access the data.
The project is designed to support the European 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) Initiative.
GDI will drive the development, deployment, and operation of sustainable data-access infrastructures within each participating country, including the legal frameworks, operational procedures, and ethics principles required to foster and maintain citizens' trust in cross-border access to highly sensitive personal data. It will unlock a data network of over 1 million genome sequences for research and clinical reference, thus creating unprecedented opportunities for routine transnational, multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for common, rare, and infectious diseases.

The Norwegian contribution is led by Professor emeritus Eivind Hovig from the ELIXIR Oslo node in collaboration with Kjell Petersen from the ELIXIR Bergen node and the Norwegian Directorate of Health.
