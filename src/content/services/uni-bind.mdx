## Introduction

UniBind is a portal to access a database storing collections of direct interactions between transcription factors and DNA (also called transcription factor binding sites) in nine species. This portal provides a comprehensive map of direct interactions between transcription factor (TFs) and DNA. High confidence TF binding site predictions were obtained from uniform processing of thousands of ChIP-seq data sets using the ChIP-eat software. This service is hosted by the University of Oslo, ELIXIR Norway.

Datasets in UniBind are separated into robust and permissive collections based on two quality control metrics. First, we filtered out datasets where the DAMO-optimized TF binding motif was not similar to the expected canonical motif. Second, we filtered out datasets where TFBSs are not enriched around their summits. Datasets satisfying both criteria were classified as part as the robust collection, while the rest were classified as part of the permissive collection.
