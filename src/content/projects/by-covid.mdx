BY-COVID is a project funded under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme. 

This will enable scientists to respond faster to new strains of SARS-CoV-2 or to new viruses. 
It will also help policy-makers assess the impact of the disease and take the most appropriate measures to protect people against new viral diseases.
ELIXIR Norway's contribution has been to contribute to work package 1 on support for virological analyses in emerging disease outbreaks (UiT). The Centre for Information Technology (USIT) at the University of Oslo has been contributing to work package 5 on facilitating secondary use of COVID-19 vaccine trial data and biosamples to test existing vaccines against emerging variants, using TSD as the data repository to access trial data.
