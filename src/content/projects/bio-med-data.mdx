BioMedData, established in 2020 and funded by the Research Council of Norway, is a national research infrastructure dedicated to promoting FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data management practices within the life sciences. Coordinated by ELIXIR Norway, BioMedData collaborates with 11 Norwegian life-science infrastructures, including leading universities such as the University of Bergen, University of Oslo, the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, NTNU Trondheim, and NMBU Ås.

The primary goal of BioMedData is to ensure that research data is managed in a way that maximizes its potential for reuse and discovery. This involves developing domain-specific guidance for data management plans (DMPs) and providing tools and resources to support researchers. One notable effort is the Data Stewardship Wizard, which helps researchers create smart DMPs by offering expert recommendations and tailored guidance.

BioMedData’s activities are integral to the national effort to advance life science research, supporting a wide range of domains and technologies. The infrastructure not only aids in the efficient management and sharing of data but also accelerates research processes, enabling scientists to tackle societal challenges such as health in old age, food security and biomedical innovation.

This project initiated in 2022 the Life-Science RDM Group, a group to facilitate exchange knowledge, experiences and good practices, open to all interested.(link to join or read more)

BioMedData is coordinated by ELIXIR Norway, and involves currently eleven data generating life science infrastructures within genomics (NorSeq, NIMG), proteomics (NAPI), imaging (NALMIN; NorMOLIM), biodiversity (GBIF Norway), biobanks (Biobank Norway, MoBa), structure determination (NorCryst), nuclear magnetic resonance (NNP) and small molecule screening (NOR-OPENSCREEN). Through BioMedData, we are building a national network of data management experts across these infrastructures, promoting and facilitating professionalised and harmonised FAIR data management services towards the users of the partner infrastructures.
