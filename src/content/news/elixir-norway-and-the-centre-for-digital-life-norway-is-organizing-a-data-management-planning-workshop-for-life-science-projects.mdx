**We are pleased to announce the Data Management planning workshop for Life Scientists in Norway by ELIXIR Norway and Digital Life Norway.**

All projects that receive funding from the Norwegian RCN are required
to submit a data management plan as soon as possible after the contract
with the RCN has been signed. All Norwegian universities now also
require a DMP for all projects. This workshop focuses on how-to
generate a data management plan for a Life Science research project
that will meet the requirements of the RCN.

We would like to invite researchers (PhD candidates, Post Doctoral Fellows,
Researchers, Associate Professors and Professors) in existing and upcoming
Life Science projects to develop their DMP in this workshop. Maximum
number of participants: 45

For a more detailed description and the agenda for the event,
