**ELIXIR in collaboration with NORBIS are pleased to announce an advanced online course about genome assembly and annotation. The course is aimed at researchers interested in learning more about genome assembly and annotation.**

It will include an introduction to general concepts and then continue to step-by-step describe all major components of a genome assembly and annotation workflow, from raw data all the way to a final assembled and annotated genome. There will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practical exercises using command line Linux. After the course the participants will be aware of common practices and commonly used tools and be able to run assembly and annotation projects on their own.
