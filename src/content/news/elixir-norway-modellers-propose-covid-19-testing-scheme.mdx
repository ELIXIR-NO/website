The COVID-19 epidemic has caused significant societal challenges, and it is
of utmost important to identify approaches to mitigate the impact of the
disease. The ELIXIR Norway expertise in computational modeling of biological
systems can aid in this process.

Personnel from our Trondheim node has participated in the development
of a high-fidelity disease spreading computational model for Norway. Their
simulations, applied to accurate demographic data of Oslo show that, in
contrast to random testing, a structured testing regime will have the
added benefit of serving as an intervention by markedly reducing the level
of spread.
