## Projects for the Research Data tool hackathon

For this hackathon, we are encouraging you to apply with an RDM tool project. We are looking for more long-term projects that will be maintained after the hackathon, and not limited to short-term research projects. 

## Funding:
We will support your participation if your project is selected through an application process evaluated by our selection committee. Funding will be available for up to 3 invited members per team for 4-5 teams, and the maximum support is 7000 NOK per person.

## Selected projects:
 

### DH-lab at the Norwegian National Library


    DH-lab provides a research infrastructure for programmatic access to digitised material from the Norwegian National Library, with a focus on text and experimental support for images. It supports both large-scale projects and individual research, including master's and PhD theses. Researchers can query and extract features from the full corpus of published Norwegian texts—books, newspapers, periodicals—via a documented REST API. Python wrappers and example notebooks are available to simplify integration, enabling tasks like corpus creation, concordance extraction, frequency and dispersion analysis. Lightweight web apps also allow users to explore data without coding. The infrastructure is designed for reproducible research and supports workflows from quick prototyping to scalable data processing. See the homepage and GitHub repo for endpoints, usage examples, and starter code.

### The NMRlipids Project

    The NMRlipids 2025 Hackathon and Workshop is organised as a part of the OSCARS FAIRMD project focused on Streamlining Biomolecule Simulation Re-Use with the FAIR NMRlipids Databank. The latter is an established collaborative open-science databank maintained by the NMRlipids project. Currently, NMRlipids Databank hosts both simulation and experimental data on lipid bilayers with the extensive possibility of quality evaluation of simulations and giving both API and GUI access to the hosted data. In the FAIRMD project, the databank will be extended also to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).

### Omnipy support for RO-Crates

    Omnipy is a new Python library that offers a systematic and scalable approach to research data and metadata wrangling. It provides interactive, hands-on access to local data or outputs from remote APIs – all parsed into data models that are as general or specific as you want. You can import, browse and convert any data, and seamlessly scale up dataflows for remote deployment. The suggested project is to add support for Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) to Omnipy. "RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata." Omnipy already has powerful support for batch operations on directories of data files, just as simple as with single files. Improving this functionality with support for metadata related to the individual files and the dataset as such makes Omnipy, in principle, a perfect fit for creating and managing RO-Crates.

### EDAM for biodiversity genomics, biodiversity monitoring, systematics, conservation biology, and ecology domains.

    EDAM is an ontology of data analysis, modelling, and data management, used widely across life sciences and beyond. It is one of the key building stones in FAIRification of scientific data, tools, and other resources (e.g. workflows, standards, learning materials, etc.). EDAM enables the first principle of FAIR: findability. The aim of this hackathon project is the extension of EDAM towards a well-balanced coverage of the biodiversity genomics, biodiversity monitoring, systematics, conservation biology, and ecology domains. I would like to invite a diverse group of professionals in these fields, to use their expertise and provide the necessary content and conceptualisation for this work. The second part of this project will be dedicated to the registration, annotation, and curation of tools and workflows used in these domains. For this, we will use the bio.tools and WorkflowHub registries, and potentially also Galaxy. Doing such annotation in parallel with the extension of EDAM is a well-proven heuristics for achieving a good level of detail in the ontology. It will also immediately use the new and updated EDAM concepts for the practical FAIRification of tools and workflows, making them globally findable and thus reusable by both professional and citizen scientists.
