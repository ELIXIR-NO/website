**In the writing moment 414 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are accessible in NCBI and many more are being sequenced world-wide. In addition, the sequence data is being made publicly available.**

ELIXIR Norway has made available SARS-CoV-2 analysis workflows in Galaxy
for both pre-processing of raw Illumina data and for variant analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 sequence reads against a complete reference genome. The
workflows are available at the NeLS Galaxy instance hosted at NTNU.

The following workflows are now available:

* [Pre-processing multiple PE samples](https://galaxy-ntnu.bioinfo.no/u/ehj000/p/covid19-preprocess-collections)
* [Pre-processing single PE samples](https://galaxy-ntnu.bioinfo.no/u/ehj000/p/preprocess-covid19-single-sample)
* [Single nucleotide variation analysis](https://galaxy-ntnu.bioinfo.no/u/ehj000/p/covid19)

For help or questions regarding the analysis workflows, please contact the
national ELIXIR helpdesk: [contact@bioinfo.no](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no)
