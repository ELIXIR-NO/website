The Genome of Europe (GoE) project encompasses 51 partners across 29 European countries to establish a unique pan-European reference database comprising a minimum of 100.000 genomes representative of European citizens in alignment with the [1+ Million Genomes initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes).

The key objectives include:

- implementing a pan-European community of practice that will generate the reference genome through integration of existing genome datasets;
- de novo sequencing from diverse national populations;
- defining the ethical, legal and societal conditions for generating the reference genome, ensuring data security; and
- embedding GoE data within the [Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/projects/genomic-data-infrastructure).

The value and usability of the GoE will be assessed through use cases focusing on genetic diversity, establishing multi-ancestry imputation services, and recalibrating genetic risk profiles. Beyond the project, GoE will be highly relevant for genetic-phenotypic discoveries, helping national genome programs, and integration of genomics into the [European Health Data Space (EHDS)](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space_en).

The GoE project prioritises public engagement, transparency, and adaptability for future extensions, ensuring responsible and sustainable genomic advancements. Integration with other European initiatives enhances its potential impact for personalised medicine, and aligns with broader scientific and healthcare goals including the European competitiveness in genomic research and innovation.

ELIXIR Belgium primarily contributes to Work Package 4 on Data Infrastructure, focusing on enabling the submission and analysis of GoE data within the 1+MG data infrastructure developed by the GDI project. The team will assist in upgrading or developing new infrastructure services, deploying services across nodes, and demonstrating the implementation of GoE use cases.
