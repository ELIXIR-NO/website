**We are happy to announce that the first Norwegian SARS-CoV-2 sequences now are openly available in [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), the European Nucleotide Archive.**

In collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ([NIPH](https://www.fhi.no/en/)), ELIXIR Norway has implemented technical solutions that prepare the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data for export to ENA, including pipelines for removing human reads from viral data sets, upload data to NeLS, the Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Sciences, attaching associated metadata to raw data and export of data to ENA and GISAID, using a standard template for both repositories.
  
These efforts are maintained as part of the latest uplift to the H2020 project [ELIXIR-CONVERGE](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge). Professor Nils Peder Willassen co-leads an amended work package to mobilise viral genomes from national sequencing efforts in Europe and beyond into truly open data resources, will enable surveillance of COVID-19 variants and make data on the spread of variants rapidly available for analysis.
