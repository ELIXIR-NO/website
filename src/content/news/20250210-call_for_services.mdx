## Who does my tool profit from being an ELIXIR service?

ELIXIR is a leading pan-European research infrastructure that offers a wealth of resources, including databases, analysis tools, and training. 
By becoming part of ELIXIR, your service will benefit from increased visibility and integration with a broad scientific community. 
This recognition can also enhance your chances of securing future funding. 
As an ELIXIR-associated service, you can also meet potential new collaborators, 
and benefit from a network providing similar services as yours and a suite of expanding tools to assist such operations.

## Who Can Apply?

We welcome proposals from groups at our partner institutionsâ€”UiB, UiT, NTNU, UiO, and NMBU. 
Eligible resources include any bioinformatics tools that support life science research, such as databases, data resources, tools, workflows, web services, and training activities. 
The only requirement is that these resources must be open to external users (commercial resources are not eligible).

## Three Levels of Service

ELIXIR Norway offers three distinct service levels to maximise the impact and reach of your bioinformatics tools:

1. **Norway Node Services**: Focused on serving the Norwegian scientific community.
1. **ELIXIR Norway Selected Node Services**: Part of the international ELIXIR service portfolio, reaching a global audience.
1. **ELIXIR Multi-Node Services**: These are services provided collaboratively by two or more ELIXIR Nodes, 
  working together on one or more activities required to deliver the service. 
  This collaboration enhances the service's capabilities and reach.
