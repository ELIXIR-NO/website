## Introduction

MirGeneDB is a database of manually curated microRNA genes that have been validated and annotated as initially described in Fromm et al. 2015. MirGeneDB 2.1 includes more than 16,000 microRNA gene entries representing more than 1,500 miRNA families from 75 metazoan species. All microRNAs can be browsed, searched and downloaded. Among the features MirGeneDB provides, are an overview page where all data is shown in summary representation, simple navigation through gene- and specie-rich sites and visual representation of a normalized expression heatmap (RPM) of all samples on the browse-section for each species (now with downloadable count matrix).
