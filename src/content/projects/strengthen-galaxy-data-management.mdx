This project focuses on improving Galaxy's data management features to provide additional provenance information and improve the integration of Galaxy in the existing data management ecosystem. Among the goals, we aim to make the Galaxy Data Libraries more scalable and further improve the reusability features of the platform by metadata enrichment. The Galaxy metadata system will be extended to enable the export of analysis records together with their provenance to relevant ELIXIR Core Data Resources and registries (e.g. WorkflowHub).

A strong focus is put on the integration of EGA, FAIRtracks, and the GA4GH Beacon network into Galaxy to support analyses of human data. Therefore, support for user-level encrypted data processing is also added to allow for the analysis of sensitive data. To this end, we include an encryption layer in the Pulsar network and enhance performance by increasing the data locality of distributed Galaxy analyses through a prototype data caching network.
