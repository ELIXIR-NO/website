**ELIXIR Norway together with the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform is running a survey to collect input from potential users that will become topics in the coming workshop in autumn 2021**

The ELIXIR Interoperability Platform will be organising a workshop in autumn 2021 on the FAIRification of genomic tracks (genome browser data) using a novel recommended interoperability resource: FAIRtracks. We are currently running a survey to collect input from potential users. We invite the broad community of researchers, data providers, developers, data curators, and other interested parties to participate. Please forward the link through your local channels if relevant.
