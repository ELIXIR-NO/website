summary: ""
status: "ongoing"
period: "1 January 2024 - 31 December 2026"

The ELIXIR Data Platform has been successful in creating a vibrant group of people interested in all aspects of life science data, from generation and curation to storage, archiving, use and reuse. It has achieved its first mission and defined a sustainable and well-funded collection of Core Data Resources that represent the gold standard. It has more recently begun developing and defining tools to boost data integration and curation capacities and helped grow a coordinated ecosystem of Node Data Resources within ELIXIR.

During this 3-year project, the Data Platform will focus on three key themes: strengthening data connectivity and accessibility through brokering, recognition and credit attribution for contributors, and FAIRification of existing data. It will also work to support a greater diversity of data resources by defining their context, quality and unique challenges within the ELIXIR framework. Key to achieving this, is its ability to leverage the robust network of ELIXIR members to connect data users, contributors and resources across Nodes.

The Platform will deliver the services and support through 4 work packages:

WP2: Connecting and brokering Node contributions to ELIXIR Data resources
WP3: Recognition and credit attribution of research contributions to data resources
WP4: Scalable curation support from the long tail of biological data
WP5: Establishing and shaping the landscape of Core and Community Biological Databases

A total of twelve ELIXIR Nodes, and the ELIXIR Hub, are participating in this project: ELIXIR Switzerland, ELIXIR Belgium (Flora Dâ€™Anna, Bert Droesbeke, Tom Lenaerts), ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Spain, ELIXIR France, ELIXIR United Kingdom, EMBL-EBI, ELIXIR Greece, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Sweden, and ELIXIR Slovenia.
