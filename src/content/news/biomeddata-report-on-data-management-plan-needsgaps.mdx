The 11 Norwegian Life Science Research Infrastructures in the [BioMedData](services/bio-med-data) project have published their **"Report on data management plan needs/gaps"**.

This report marks the conclusion of the first phase within the project, aimed at assessing the data management routines at the Norwegian Life Science infrastructures and the gap with respect to the FAIR data principles. This report is a basis for the infrastructures to plan and implement further steps to improve the data management at the infrastructures and facilitate good data management by the researchers using the infrastructures.
