## Introduction

LiceBase is a model organism database collecting genomic information and annotation of the Atlantic salmon louse, a major fish parasite with an impact on global ecology and aquaculture economy. LiceBase is the sister database of Salmobase and maintained by ELIXIR Norway. This database facilitates searching through genes and sequences related to salmon lice, through the search function, searching for blast results or bulk sequence retrieval. LiceBase also contains in-situ images uploaded by users, helpful for image comparison, an RNAi database and a collaborative forum for discussions, questions and answers on the topic of salmon lice.

## About this service

LiceBase is a specialized genomic database maintained by ELIXIR Norway, focusing on salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). This platform provides detailed genomic and transcriptomic data, aiding in the study and management of this significant marine parasite. LiceBase integrates a range of resources and tools to support researchers in understanding the biology, genetics, and impact of salmon lice on aquaculture and marine ecosystems.

## Why use this service

LiceBase is essential for marine biologists, parasitologists, and researchers in aquaculture who need comprehensive data on salmon lice. The platform facilitates in-depth genomic research, contributing to better management and control strategies for salmon lice infestations. By using LiceBase, researchers can access high-quality data and tools that enhance their understanding of the parasiteâ€™s biology and genetics. This can lead to significant advancements in managing the impact of salmon lice on fish populations and aquaculture.
