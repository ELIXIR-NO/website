        # ELIXIR Norway

        ELIXIR Norway is a national node of [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/), the pan-European
        infrastructure for _biological information_, supporting life science research
        and its translation to medicine, the environment, the bioindustries and society.

        ELIXIR Norway is funded by the [Research Council of Norway](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/),
        its partner institutions, and the [ELIXIR Hub](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/hub).
        ELIXIR Norway builds upon the Norwegian Bioinformatics Platform, which has
        provided support and tools for Norwegian life science research for over two decades.
