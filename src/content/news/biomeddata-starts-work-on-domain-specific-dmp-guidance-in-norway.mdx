In a joint effort representatives from all research infrastructures in [BioMedData](/services/bio-med-data) have gathered for a 2-day online workshop to perform the first steps towards domain specific guidance for researchers in their data management. This work will result in the near future in expert recommendation for different domains and technologies which can be imported to new data management plans, forming the basis for more efficient research.

One important factor to accelerate these efforts was the advice from the [Data Stewardship Wizard development team](https://ds-wizard.org/about.html) on collective editing of Knowledge Models in the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/) during the workshop.
