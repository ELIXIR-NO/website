EOSC-Life: Fostering Open Science in Life Sciences

EOSC-Life brings together 13 Life Science ‘ESFRI’ research infrastructures (LS RIs) to create a comprehensive, open, and collaborative digital space for biological and medical research. This ambitious project aims to publish FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data and provide a catalog of services that facilitate the management, storage, and reuse of data within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). By linking data resources to open and reusable tools and workflows, EOSC-Life ensures that these valuable resources are accessible to European research communities through national and international life-science clouds.

ELIXIR Norway plays a crucial role in EOSC-Life, particularly in the amended Work Package 14 (WP14) focused on ‘COVID-19 Data Trials.’ This initiative involves the design, development, implementation, and use of a secure repository for individual participant data from COVID-19 trials. The University of Oslo’s Services for Sensitive Data (TSD) provides the secure environment for this repository, with its beta version launched in February 2021. Through these contributions, ELIXIR Norway helps ensure that critical data is available and safely stored and shared advancing research and facilitating a coordinated response to the pandemic.
