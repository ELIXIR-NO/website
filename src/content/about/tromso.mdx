# Tromsø node

Located at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/startsida), the ELIXIR Norway node in Tromsø specialises in the study of microbial organisms from the Arctic oceans and human-associated bacteria. Our team, based in the [department of Biological Chemistry and Bioinformatics (BCB)](https://uit.no/research/bcb), is equipped to support your research with a range of specialised services.

## What We Offer
- **Bioinformatics analysis**  
From genome assembly to differential expression analysis, we specialise in nucleic acid omics data analysis. Our expertise spans transcriptomics, genomics, and metagenomics, helping you unlock meaningful insights from complex biological data. Whether you need standard analytical pipelines or custom solutions, we ensure robust and reproducible results that advance your research goals.

- **Research Support & Data Management**  
In today's era of rapid technological advancement and increasingly complex bioinformatics analysis, designing robust experiments that yield high-quality data is crucial. At ELIXIR UIT, we offer specialised expertise to help you design future projects that meet all technical and analytical requirements. Through our collaboration with the UiT University Library, we provide comprehensive data management planning services, ensuring your research adheres to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and funding agency requirements. From project conception to completion, we transform data management from a requirement into a valuable asset for your research.

- **Software Development & Engineering**  
Our team of professional software engineers delivers end-to-end solutions for research and biomedical applications. We specialise in:
