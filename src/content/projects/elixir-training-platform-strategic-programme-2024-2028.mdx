The ELIXIR Training Platform (TrP) is building a network of training resources and services, aiming for collaboration, visibility, and standardisation. SPLASH, a digital hub, showcases core services like TeSS, enhancing the training life cycle. Work Packages focus on infrastructure, guidelines, and Train-the-Trainer resources. Collaboration across ELIXIR entities is essential, as are standardised guidelines and a supportive community for knowledge sharing. The project's success will transform training delivery within the community.
