**The Global Biodata Coalition (GBC) today announces the first list of
Global Core Biodata Resources (GCBRs)—a collection of 37 resources
whose long-term funding and sustainability is critical to life science
and biomedical research worldwide.**

Explore the list here: [Global Core Biodata Resources](https://globalbiodata.org/scientific-activities/global-core-biodata-resources) (GCBRs).

Researchers the world over rely on data resources to manage, curate and provide
access to research data. These resources include deposition databases, which archive
and preserve primary research data, and knowledge bases which draw together
and add value to these data through expert curation and annotation
enabling those data to be mined, combined and used to advance research.

The Research Council of Norway (RCN) is one of the members of the Global
Biodata Coalition (GBC), and is represented by Professor Inge Jonassen,
Head of UiB Department of Informatics, in the GBC board.
**Professor Jonassen** says:

> I am very pleased that RCN is among the first funding agencies to
help build the GBC. The biodata resources are of fundamental importance
for life science research and innovation, and for example, they were
crucial to enable a quick response towards the Covid19 pandemic.

Like keystone species in an ecosystem, GCBRs represent the most
crucial components or nodes within the global life science data infrastructure,
whose failure would have a critical impact on the global research endeavour.
A key property of the GCBRs is that the data they hold is available openly
and can be accessed and used without restriction by researchers the world over.

The GBC brings together major public and charitable funders, who are committed
to work in partnership to develop more sustainable funding approaches to support
biodata resources — many of which currently rely on short-term, unstable funding.
This first set of GCBRs were selected through a rigorous two-stage process
open tobiodata resources globally (see [Global Core Biodata Resources:
Concept and Selection Process](https://zenodo.org/record/5845116#.Y5o-lC_JKAM)).

More than 60 resources submitted expressions of interest, for which
it was necessary that they met several eligibility criteria.
At each stage of the selection process, the candidate biodata
resources were assessed by a panel of more than 50 independent expert
reviewers against a series of criteria that included their scientific
focus, the size and reach of their user communities, their quality of
service, their governance, and their impact on global research.

The process of identifying the Global Core Biodata Resources builds in the
efforts in Europe to identify and sustain ELIXIR core data resources.
**Professor Sushma Grellscheid**, Head of ELIXIR Norway says:

> This is a significant moment for bioinformatics globally, and we are excited
to be at the centre of this development within the vibrant bioinformatics
environment here at UiB.

The GBC’s partner funders will now actively work with the community
of GCBRs to explore funding models that ensure these biodata resources
are able to develop and sustain the critical services they
provide to the global research community.

It is envisaged that the list of GCBRs will grow and develop over time,
and there will be further opportunities for resources to apply to
be considered for GCBR status over the coming years.

**Warwick Anderson**, Chair of the GBC Board of Funders, said,

> We were delighted by the response to the first call for Global Core
> Biodata Resources. Thank you to all resources who applied and to the
> reviewers who gave their time and expertise so generously. The quality
> and breadth of this list highlights the critical importance of GBC’s
> mission to ensure these fundamental resources receive long-term
> sustainable funding

**Guy Cochrane**, Executive Director of the GBC, said,

> The announcement of the list will enable funders and biodata resources
to come together to co-develop sustainability models that meet their needs,
and ensure that these data resources are able to continue to support
the global research community.

**Eric Green**, Director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute and GBC Board Member said,

> Selecting this first set of GCBRs is an important step for better
understanding the broader ecosystem of data resources that are vital
to life science and biomedical research. It also represents a starting
point for enhanced discussions with various research communities and
their funders about how best to ensure the long-term sustainability of
vital biodata resources
