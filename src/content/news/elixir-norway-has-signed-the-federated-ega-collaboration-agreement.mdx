**Upon completing the signing of the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive
(EGA) Collaboration Agreement end of last week, ELIXIR Norway formally
joined the Federated EGA collaboration, and were warmly welcomed and
greeted as the first Federated EGA node to join the FEGA network!**

Reaching this milestone after many years of dedicated efforts, allows
the FEGA Norway node to enter a production phase where we can contribute
to the FAIR sharing of sensitive research data in Europe and
internationally, and help medical research requiring sharing of sensitive
biomedical data such as genome and phenotype information to progress
further.

[The Federated EGA Norway node](https://ega.elixir.no) is an ELIXIR
Norway service operated with University of Oslo as the Service Provider.
It depends heavily on the [TSD infrastructure](https://www.uio.no/tsd)
(Tjenester for Sensitive Data), and the deployed service software is
a result of our long-standing collaboration between the Nordic
ELIXIR Nodes in the series of NeIC Tryggve projects and our Central
EGA partners [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) and [CRG](https://www.crg.eu).

Thank you to all colleagues, collaborators and partners that has
made this achievement possible!
