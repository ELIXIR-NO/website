We are pleased to announce the Data Management planning workshop
for Life Scientists in Norway by ELIXIR Norway and
Digital Life Norway.

All Norwegian universities require a DMP for all projects. All
projects that receive funding from the Norwegian RCN are required
to submit a data management plan as soon as possible after the
contract with the RCN has been signed. This workshop focuses
on how-to generate a data management plan for a Life Science
research project that will meet both requirements.

We would like to invite researchers (PhD candidates, Post Doctoral
Fellows, Researchers, Associate Professors and Professors) in
existing and upcoming Life Science projects to develop their
DMP in this workshop.

- Maximum number of participants: `45`
- The workshop will take place if there is at least `10` participants
