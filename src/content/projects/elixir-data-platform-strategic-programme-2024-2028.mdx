# Platform highlights:
* ELIXIR Core Data Resources: European data resources that are of fundamental importance to research in the life sciences and are committed to the long-term preservation of data.
* ELIXIR Deposition Databases: repositories recommended for the deposition of life sciences experimental data.
* Data resource services: this list is updated as Nodes finalise or review their Service Delivery Plans (see How countries join).

The Platform is organised into five Work Packages:

* WP1: Management and coordination 
* WP2: Connecting and brokering Node contributions to ELIXIR data resources
* WP3: Recognition and credit attribution of research contributions to data resources
* WP4: Scalable curation support from the long tail of biological data
* WP5: Establishing and shaping the landscape of Core and Community biological databases

ELIXIR Norway is participating in WP2.
