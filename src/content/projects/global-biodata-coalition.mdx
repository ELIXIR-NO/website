The Global Biodata Coalition (GBC) is committed to stabilizing and securing sustainable funding for vital global biodata resources. By bringing together funders and leaders from around the world, the GBC aims to ensure that essential life science, biological, and biomedical data remain freely and openly available to all.

The coalition's mission involves identifying and prioritizing a set of Global Core Data Resources (GCDRs) that are crucial for maintaining the broader biodata infrastructure. The GBC works to enhance international coordination, sustainable funding models, and streamlined support mechanisms for these resources. Through initiatives like the GCBR Forum, the coalition develops sustainability models that address the diverse needs of the global biodata ecosystem.

ELIXIR Norway, alongside the Research Council of Norway, is actively engaged in the GBC's mission. Professor Inge Jonassen, Head of Node at ELIXIR Norway, serves on the interim steering board, contributing to the strategic direction and implementation of the coalition's goals. ELIXIR Norway's involvement ensures that Norwegian expertise and resources support the global efforts to secure and sustain biodata infrastructure, fostering innovation and collaboration in life sciences research.
