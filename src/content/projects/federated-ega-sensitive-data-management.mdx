The Deliverables from this project will be incorporated into the FEGA governance framework
to roadmap the maturity of the service, enabling FEGA to meet the needs of the sensitive
human data management use cases from the ELIXIR Nodes. To accomplish this goal, the
project will act as a coordination hub to establish contact points with Nodes and projects to
gather existing and emerging use-cases, map the engagement with the projects and
Federated EGA, identify areas for collaboration on common goals, and act as a convening
group to communicate the Federated EGA project status to the wider ELIXIR community.
This broad alignment role across Nodes and existing key projects will strategically place the
Federated EGA infrastructure at the centre of European transnational sharing of sensitive
human data.

ELIXIR Norway is one of five vanguard nodes and is contributing by capacity building of the national FEGA node and to position the Federated EGA framework as the core infrastructure driver to support human data sharing for research use-cases from nationally, European Commission, and/or internationally funded human health data sharing projects. [FEGA Norway](https://ega.elixir.no/) has been operational since November 2023.
