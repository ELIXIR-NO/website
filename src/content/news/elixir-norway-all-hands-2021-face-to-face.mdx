**Our annual ‘All hands’ meeting took place in Bergen 19-21 October, and finally
we were able to gather ‘the family’ physically again!**

The meeting was kicked off by Andrew Smith, Head of External Relations
at the ELIXIR Hub, who nicely summarised important aspects on how
to build an effective and sustainable ELIXIR Node.

Main topics during this year’s meeting included ELIXIR’s response
to the Covid-19 pandemic, data management, summarising the ‘ELIXIR2’
period, which soon will come to an end, and planning the next phase,
‘ELIXIR3’, which starts next year. The full program can

In addition, we were very happy to have developers of
[all our new services](news/50/63/New-Norwegian-bioinformatics-services-promoted-by-ELIXIR-Norway)
joining the meeting, to introduce their service, get to know each other
and learn how to best collaborate. Thanks everyone for taking
the time to join us!

We were also very grateful to finally meet with our scientific advisory committee
and stakeholder panel again, who provided invaluable feedback, input and advice
on our operation. As in earlier years, the meeting was closed with an
ELIXIR Norway board meeting on Thursday afternoon.

A huge thank you to everyone who contributed with talks, questions, comments
and input! See you all next year—hopefully once again face to face.
