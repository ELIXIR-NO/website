# Introduction

The Marine Metagenomics Portal provides access to high-quality curated
and freely accessible marine microbial genomics and metagenomics
resources. It includes the MAR databases, a collection of richly
annotated and manually curated contextual and sequence databases,
and MetaPipe, a complete workflow for the analysis of marine
metagenomic data.

The Marine Metagenomics Portal provides freely accessible
microbial genomics and metagenomics reference databases that
include MarRef, MarDB, and MarCat. The MMP also includes a
search engine that you can use to query all three databases at
once.

This service is run by the University of Tromsø, ELIXIR
Norway, as one of three service offered under the ELIXIR Microbiome
community. The goals of this community is to develop
standards for FAIR microbiome analyses, providing support
in data, tools, workflows and federated computation. They
also aim to Represent the Microbiome Community in its complexity
and build capacity in [microbiome analyses](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/microbiome).

# About this service

The Marine Metagenomics Portal (MMP), managed by the University
of Tromsø and ELIXIR Norway, provides high-quality, curated
databases for marine microbial genomics and metagenomics research.

It includes resources like MarRef, MarDB, and MarCat, which are
essential for analyzing marine metagenomic data. MMP supports
the ELIXIR Microbiome community's goal of developing standards
for FAIR microbiome analyzes. The portal offers a range
of tools and databases to facilitate marine microbial
research and data management.

# Why use this service?

MMP is invaluable for marine biologists, microbiologists,
and bioinformaticians focusing on marine microbial genomics.
It offers comprehensive resources for analyzing and interpreting
marine metagenomic data. The portal's high-quality curated
databases ensure accurate and reliable data analysis,
promoting scientific discovery. By using MMP, researchers
can access a wealth of information and tools to support
their marine microbial research projects.
