**The first meeting between the Research Infrastructure Project
Area Liaison (RI PAL) in BioMedData (BMD) was held September 2nd.**

ELIXIR Norway is hosting the hub of BMD, and is responsible
for the coordination and management through a Data Management Coordinator.
Each participating RI has appointed a PAL that is part of
that infrastructure and has responsibility for data management
within the RI. A major goal of BMD is to create an operational
network of personnel playing central roles within data management,
across infrastructures, where the aim is to facilitate
day-to-day contact. This was the first meeting in a meeting
serie that will carry on every second week.
