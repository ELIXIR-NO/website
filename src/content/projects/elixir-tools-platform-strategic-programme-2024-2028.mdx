The ELIXIR Tools Platform provides services that enable findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of computational tools, including research software, workflows, remote digital services, and trained machine-learning (ML) models.

We aim at optimising these services to suit the needs of molecular life sciences and, at the same time, 
to serve a broader range of interdisciplinary applications and scientific communities, including EOSC. 
The overall goal of the Tools Platform is to sustain the required services and expand them to fulfil the ELIXIR Programme 2024-2028.

The Tools Platform aims to:

* Allow researchers (end-users) to find well-described and fit-for-purpose research software, providing alternatives when available, that can be used in heterogeneous computational setups, from a laptop to a cloud installation to an HPC centre
* Serve as a reference point for individual research software engineers on how to develop better, more sustainable, and recognisable software by providing best practices and services supporting such endeavour
* Provide scientific communities with a reference place for tackling common challenges, deriving their own best practices for software development from a laptop to a cloud installation to an HPC centre
