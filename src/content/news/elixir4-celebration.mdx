Great news from the Research Council of Norway! The ELIXIR4 Open Life Science project, led by **Professor Sushma Grellscheid at CBU**, has been [approved for funding under the RCN Infrastructure program](https://www.forskningsradet.no/nyheter/2024/13-milliardar-forskingsinfrastruktur/). This grant marks the fourth in a series of investments that provide foundational support for Norway’s node in the European research infrastructure ELIXIR, dedicated to biological data.

With a substantial funding request of 124.5 million kroner for a period of five years, this initiative will involve approximately 50 individuals across the country and will enhance Norway's participation in vital European networks focused on bioinformatics. The projects supported by ELIXIR4 are linked to significant fields such as cancer research, biodiversity studies, and pathogen surveillance, utilizing advanced data science and AI techniques.

This achievement underscores the importance of ELIXIR as an intergovernmental organization fostering research collaboration across 25 countries, especially in today’s geopolitical landscape. This grant secures Norway's continued contribution to the ELIXIR mission.

Our gratitude is extended to our project partners at all five universities, as well as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute. The support across the partner institutions has been invaluable, with contributions from rectors, deans, and department heads.

This has been made possible by the ELIXIR Noway sub-node leaders, coordinators and everyone in ELIXIR Norway through their dedication and collaboration. Together, we are excited to enable life sciences in Norway and beyond!
