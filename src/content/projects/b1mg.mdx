The Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG) consortium will provide coordination and support to the 1+ Million Genomes initiative (1+MG), which is based upon the commitment of 21 European Member States and Norway that have signed the Declaration "Towards access to at least 1 million sequenced genomes in the EU by 2022". 

ELIXIR Norway plays a crucial role in this initiative, contributing expertise and infrastructure to ensure harmonised metadata and data management of provenance of the 1+MG workflow in addition to helping build a sustainable software stack that can be deployed nationally to ensure secure, federated access to genomic data for research and clinical use
