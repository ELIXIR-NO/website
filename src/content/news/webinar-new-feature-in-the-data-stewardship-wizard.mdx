**BioMedData coordinators are organizing a webinar about a new feature in the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW) for Norway Friday, 08 April 2022 @ 09:00 - 11:00**

The new feature allows the user to start from a pre-filled questionnaire ("Exemplar DMP") containing recommendations provided by domain experts. This feature was developed in a collaboration between the [BioMedData infrastructure](/services/bio-med-data) coordinated by ELIXIR-NO and the Data Stewardship Wizard team from ELIXIR-CZ.
