Read the exciting story about [how the new service immuneML uses AI to diagnose diseases](https://titan.uio.no/medisin-informatikk/2022/fra-bare-en-blodprove-kan-kunstig-intelligens-gi-diagnose-for-mange-ulike-sykdommer) in the University of Oslo science newspaper Titan (Norwegian).

[immuneML](https://immuneml.uio.no) uses AI to find patterns among our immune receptors that are correlated to diseases. In this way, the tool may help us diagnose diseases and infectious agents.

[immuneML](https://immuneml.uio.no) was included as an ELIXIR Norway national service in 2021, read more about this process [here](news/50/63/New-Norwegian-bioinformatics-services-promoted-by-ELIXIR-Norway).
