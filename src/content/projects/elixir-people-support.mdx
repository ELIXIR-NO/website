The PeoplePulse project underscores ELIXIR's commitment to nurturing a skilled, diverse and collaborative community for staff. 

This project focuses on these critical aspects of people development:

* Improving the onboarding process â€“ the gateway for people new to the ELIXIR network
* Delineating roles that cater for a spectrum of expertise
* Developing innovative training concepts tailored to the challenges of ELIXIR
* Sharing success stories and best practices from people development initiatives

The Norwegian node is involved in the development of training on how to assess both environmental impact and the impact of the nodes.
