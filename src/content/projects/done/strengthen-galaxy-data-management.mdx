This project focuses on the enhancement of Galaxy's data management features to provide additional provenance information and improve the integration of Galaxy in the existing data management ecosystem. Existing technologies and services in ELIXIR will be supported and ongoing international projects (ELIXIR-CONVERGE, the COVID-19 Data Portal, EOSC-Life, etc.) will be complemented while building on national initiatives (German NFDI, ELIXIR Belgium strategy, UK BioFAIR, etc.).

The project objectives include: making the Galaxy Data Libraries more scalable; further improvement of the reusability features of the platform by metadata enrichment; and extending the Galaxy metadata system to enable the export of analysis records together with their provenance to relevant ELIXIR Core Data Resources and registries (e.g. WorkflowHub). A strong emphasis will be on the integration of EGA, FAIRtracks, and the GA4GH Beacon network into Galaxy to support analyses of human sensitive data.

Through the improvement of these data management features, this study aims to tackle concrete current worldwide needs, like the ones related to COVID-19 (meta-)analyses.

This study is a joint effort of ELIXIR Belgium (Frederik Coppens, Ignacio Eguinoa), ELIXIR Switzerland, ELIXIR Czech, ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Spain, ELIXIR France, ELIXIR Israel, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR The Netherlands, ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Slovenia, and ELIXIR UK.
