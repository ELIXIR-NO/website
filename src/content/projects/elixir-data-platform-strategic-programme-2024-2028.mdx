The goal of the ELIXIR Data Platform is to drive the use, re-use, and value of life science data. It aims to do this by providing users with sustainable data resources within a coordinated and scalable data ecosystem.
Platform highlights:

**ELIXIR Core Data Resources**: European data resources that are of fundamental importance to research in the life sciences and are committed to the long-term preservation of data.

**ELIXIR Deposition Databases**: repositories recommended for the deposition of life sciences experimental data.

**Data resource services**: This list is updated as Nodes finalise or review their Service Delivery Plans.

The Norwegian effort is in WP2 Connecting and brokering Node contributions to ELIXIR data resources, involved in developing best practices for data brokering across ELIXIR nodes and implementing use cases for these best practices.
