# Objectives

ELIXIR STEERS ensures that ELIXIR continues to operate as a world-class Research Infrastructure (RI), and continues to enable wider participation in computational life science research. 

It will focus on a new and critical area of scientific need: the provision of software and workflows to life scientists, maximising productivity in research, and minimising consequent energy usage.

It will:
* Create a toolkit for robust, reproducible, and green software and workflows.
* Enable cross-border data analysis in the life sciences by embedding common practice across the whole European Research Area via the ELIXIR Nodes.
* Partner in Europe and internationally for global competitiveness and sustainability.

This projects is divided into 5 work-packages:
* WP1: Coordination and support
* WP2: Implementation of research software best practices through ELIXIR Communities
* WP3: Infrastructure services to enable adoption and deployment of software best practices
* WP4: Strengthening and equipping ELIXIR Nodes and Node staff with key skills and resources in organisation, management and training
* WP5: Communications, outreach, industry and international

ELIXIR Norway is involved in WP3 and WP4
