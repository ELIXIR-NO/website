We are so happy that ELIXIR Norway will be able to continue our work on enabling analysis and sharing of life science data for Norwegian researchers!

Today, the Research Council of Norway announced its [continued funding to ELIXIR Norway and 21 other infrastructure funding proposals](https://www.forskningsradet.no/nyheter/2021/22-nye-prosjekter-for-forskningsinfrastruktur/) that were submitted to their Infrastructure programme in November 2020\.  The renewed funding will allow us to upgrade and strengthen the Norwegian Node of ELIXIR and our efforts to enhance the public value of life science data generated and analysed by Norwegian scientists, with a particular focus on human health, biodiversity and integrative biology.

This investment will ultimately enable Norwegian scientists to more efficiently share, analyse and store increasing amounts and types of life science data using state-of-the-art expertise, e-infrastructure, tools and resources.
