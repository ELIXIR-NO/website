# Tromsø node

Located at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://en.uit.no/startsida), the ELIXIR Norway node in Tromsø specialises in the study of microbial organisms from the Arctic oceans and human-associated bacteria. Our team, based in the [department of Biological Chemistry and Bioinformatics (BCB)](https://uit.no/research/bcb), is equipped to support your research with a range of specialised services.

## What We Offer
- **Bioinformatics analysis** - From genome assembly to differential expression analysis, we specialise in nucleic acid omics data analysis. Our expertise spans transcriptomics, genomics, and metagenomics, helping you unlock meaningful insights from complex biological data. Whether you need standard analytical pipelines or custom solutions, we ensure robust and reproducible results that advance your research goals.

- **Research Support & Data Management** - In today's era of rapid technological advancement and increasingly complex bioinformatics analysis, designing robust experiments that yield high-quality data is crucial. At ELIXIR UIT, we offer specialised expertise to help you design future projects that meet all technical and analytical requirements. Through our collaboration with the UiT University Library, we provide comprehensive data management planning services, ensuring your research adheres to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and funding agency requirements. From project conception to completion, we transform data management from a requirement into a valuable asset for your research.

- **Software Development & Engineering** - Our team of professional software engineers delivers end-to-end solutions for research and biomedical applications. We specialise in:
    - **Full-Stack Development** - From interactive web applications to robust backend systems, we create custom software solutions that streamline research workflows and data visualisation. Our expertise spans modern web technologies, database design, and API development.
    - **Scientific Computing** - Custom algorithms, analysis pipelines, and high-performance computing solutions tailored to your research needs. We transform complex computational challenges into efficient, scalable tools.
    - **Research Tools & Automation** - Specialised scripts, data processing tools, and workflow automation solutions that accelerate your research. Whether you need a simple data processing script or a complex analytical pipeline, we deliver solutions that match your specific requirements.
    - **Database Solutions** - Design and implementation of research databases, from small-scale laboratory management systems to large-scale biomedical data repositories, ensuring efficient data organisation, access, and security.

- **Training and Capacity Building**
    - **Research Data management (RDM) courses** - We offer general RDM courses covering a range of topic from data collection and metadata management to understanding regulations for handling sensitive data. In addition, we deliver courses on what best practices to consider for FAIR data handling.
    - **Tool-specific courses** - We offer courses designed to provide hands-on experience on tools developed (by ELIXIR Norway) for your data management tasks such as [Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences](https://nels.bioinfo.no/) for storage of non-sensitive data, [UseGalaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/use/usegalaxy-no/) where you can use/create streamlined bioinformatics workflows, [local Data Stewardship Wizard instance](https://norway.dsw.elixir-europe.org/wizard/) that you can use to create Data Management Plans based on domain-specific templates relevant to the field of your research project, and [FEGA-Norway](https://ega.elixir.no/) that allows secure sharing of sensitive data across borders in compliance with data governance procedures including GDPR regulations in Norway. 
These courses are designed to help you navigate and make the most of these tools, improving your data management practices and supporting your research objectives. Whether you are looking to get started or deepen your expertise, our training courses are structured to meet the diverse needs of researchers at all levels.
    - **Train-the-Trainer** - As a national ELIXIR node, we are a part of ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer (TtT) programme that enables us to provide training on how to become a better instructor/trainer. The TtT courses touch upon various teaching techniques that can help you to ensure productive engagement from learners/trainees and make your course material easy to understand. TtT is an open instructors’ community and you can read more about it here https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/training/train-the-trainer 

## Research Impact and Initiatives
Our expertise drives critical national and international research infrastructures, including:
- The Pathogen Portal Norway
- SARS-CoV2 database
- Marine Meta-genomics Portal (MMP)
- MetaTrack
