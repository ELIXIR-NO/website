The ELIXIR Training Platform has built an extensive network that represents a wide range of training resources and services. The aim of this project is not only to manage this network but to evolve it, standardise it and connect all its different components. In doing so, a federated training establishment can be created that effectively caters to the diverse needs of the ELIXIR community.

To digitally rebrand the Training Platform, SPLASH is introduced. This acronym stands for Skills, Professional Development, Learning Assessment, Support and Help. Training SPLASH will serve as a website for the Training Platform to provide information on its operations, services, activities and standard operating procedures. The central element of the website will be the training life cycle, which will signpost the different services and working groups that the Training Platform has been working on.

The project will deliver on its objectives through 3 work packages:

- WP2: Consolidation of the Training Platform Infrastructure
- WP3: Establishment of Comprehensive Training Guidelines
- WP4: Consolidation of Train-the-Trainer Programme
