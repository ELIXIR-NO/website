Research Data Management (RDM) is crucial for implementing FAIR and Open Science principles. 
ELIXIR Platforms, Nodes, and other structures have invested in RDM, resulting in valuable tools and resources. 
The RDM Community aims to bring together RDM professionals to coordinate ELIXIR's activities and develop its vision.
The short-term objectives include:

* Creating a knowledge exchange forum,
* Coordinating the RDM ecosystem,
* Focusing on RDM training and data brokering.

To achieve these goals, DATAREX will facilitate knowledge sharing, develop resources for RDM service providers, coordinate RDM training and content, and make recommendations for enhancing data brokering services. 
This project will empower RDM professionals and contribute to improving research data management practices.
There are 19 nodes involved in this project. ELIXIR Norway is represented by [Korbinian BÃ¶sl (UiB)](https://www4.uib.no/finn-ansatte/Korbinian.B%C3%B6sl), 
[Federico Bianchini (UiO)](https://www.mn.uio.no/bils/english/people/fredebi/), and [Nazeefa Fatima (UiT)](https://uit.no/ansatte/person?p_document_id=862295&p_dimension_id=88139).
