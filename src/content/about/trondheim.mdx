# Trondheim node

The platform activity at NTNU is co-localized with the [Bioinformatics Core Facility (BioCore)](https://www.ntnu.edu/mh/biocore). The associated research group is mainly working on _gene regulation_, large-scale genomics towards cancer research and population biobanks ([HUNT](https://about.hdc.ntnu.no/)), and _prokaryote genomics_. Our collaborators include the biomedical and the biotech community, as well as private-industry.

The group develops tools for microRNA target prediction, non-coding RNA gene prediction, analysis of regulatory regions, peak finding in ChIP-seq data for transcription factors, and integrated handling and analysis of genomic data in biobanks.

The platform also develops and implements specific pipelines for analysing sequencing data, e.g. from RNA-sequencing, micro-RNA or other non-coding RNA experiments, and analysis of exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing data. The Trondheim node also has competence on sequencing data from prokaryotic genomes and metagenomic sequencing data.
