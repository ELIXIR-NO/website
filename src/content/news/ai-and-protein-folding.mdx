In this podcast ELIXIR Norway leader Inge Jonassen explains how artificial
intelligence research can drive and accelerate new scientific discoveries.

AlphaFold is an AI system that builds on decades of prior research using
large genomic datasets to predict protein structure. The 3D models of proteins
that AlphaFold generates are far more accurate than any that have come before.
