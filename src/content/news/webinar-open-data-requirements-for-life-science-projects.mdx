**Be ready to receive funding! Why is Open Data and Data Management important for my application?**

This webinar on the 31st of January (13.00 CET) from [ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no/)
will provide you with information on Open Data and Data Management requirements for
research applications to the Research Council of Norway (RCN) call for proposals
with deadline February 8th.

For projects funded by RCN [open science is now one of the assessment criteria](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/processing-grant-applications/processing-applications/assessment-open-science/)
and all funded projects must assess the need for a Data Management Plan. In this
webinar we will highlight the RCN requirements for Open Data and Data Management
from a Life Science perspective and provide a short introduction to the Data
Management Planning tool **Data Stewardship Wizard** by ELIXIR Norway.

This 45 minutes webinar will be presented by Korbinian BÃ¶sl
(ELIXIR Norway, BioMedData & Centre for Digital Life Norway)
