title: "Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG)"
summary: "The 'Beyond 1 Million Genomes' (B1MG) project aims to create a robust network for genetic and clinical data sharing across Europe. Coordinated to support the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, this project is a collaboration of 23 European countries to provide cross-border access to one million sequenced genomes by 2022. ELIXIR Norway plays a crucial role in this initiative, contributing expertise and infrastructure to ensure harmonised metadata and data management of provenance of the 1+MG workflow in addition to help building a sustainable software stack that can be deployed nationally in order to have secure, federated access to genomic data for research and clinical use."
