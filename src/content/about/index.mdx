        The ELIXIR Norway organization is structured into several roles and committees. It includes node leaders from
        different universities in Norway, coordinators for technical, training, data management, and service aspects, a
        steering board with representatives from various universities, a scientific advisory committee with
        international members, and a stakeholder panel featuring experts from academia and industry.

        We often explain and communicate the impact of work funded by, and through, ELIXIR using impact areas i.e.
        impact categories. All activities carried out under the umbrella of ELIXIR, i.e. ELIXIR related activities,
        can be attached to one or more of the impact categories (or areas) shown in illustration. These categories are a
        useful way to describe what ELIXIR related activities are meant to achieve in terms of impact.s

        We are a European intergovernmental organisation composed of life scientists, computer scientists, and support
        staff. Our mission is to enable researchers to harness the vast amounts of data produced in life sciences,
        providing new insights into how living organisms function in health and disease.

        ELIXIR Norway is part of the broader ELIXIR network, which includes 23 member countries working
        together through a "Hub and Nodes" model:

        - **ELIXIR Hub:** The ELIXIR Hub acts as the central headquarters, coordinating activities across the
        entire network. It is based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, near Cambridge, UK.
        - **ELIXIR Nodes:** Each ELIXIR member country establishes a ‘Node’—a network of organisations within
        that country. In Norway, ELIXIR Norway serves as the Node, coordinating local activities and
        collaborating with national and international partners to advance life science research.
