# Tromsø node

The ELIXIR node in Tromsø (ELIXIR@UiT) focus on microbial organisms from the arctic oceans and human associated bacteria. At ELIXIR@UiT you can get assistance related to research topics such as _metagenome analysis_, _16S rRNA amplicon analysis_, _microbial genomics_, _transcriptomics_ and _phylogenomics_. We also have competence in [building databases](https://sfb.mmp2.sigma2.no/) and _analysis pipelines_.

The node is building and maintaining the [SARS-CoV-2 Database](/services/sars-cov2-db), a knowledge database for SARS-CoV-2 virus research compiled from publicly available resources.
