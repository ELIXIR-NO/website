The [ELIXIR-CONVERGE project](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge)
has received a €2 million uplift from the European Commission (EC). The new funding aims to
mobilise SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance data tracking services and tools to feed
the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/the-european-covid-19-data-platform).
The work is led by ELIXIR Switzerland and ELIXIR Norway.

In 2020, the EC already amended the ELIXIR-CONVERGE grant with an extra €2.8 million. The
investment was destined to enhance human and viral data sharing through the ELIXIR Nodes
and support the development of the European COVID-19 Data Platform. Both the first
and second amendments have focused on enabling the rapid collection of COVID-19 data
and offering open data to improve research efficiency and pandemic preparedness.

Aitana Lebrand (SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) and our Deputy Head
of Node Nils P. Willassen (UiT The Arctic University of Norway) will co-lead
the new tasks of the project: mobilising viral genomes from national sequencing
efforts to offer true open data resources for surveilling COVID-19 variants.

The task includes setting up submission and annotation pipelines to the
[European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home) (ENA), which
will help link nascent and established national sequencing efforts to the European
COVID-19 Data Platform. In addition, such efforts will ensure the commitment to the open
sharing of variant data through the ENA.

#### About ELIXIR-CONVERGE

The ELIXIR-CONVERGE project started in February 2020 to help standardise life science
data management across Europe. It is funded from the EU’s Horizon 2020 programme and
involves 29 institutes in 22 ELIXIR Nodes.

For more information about the ELIXIR-CONVERGE Work Package 9, in which the new
tasks are carried out, you can go to our
