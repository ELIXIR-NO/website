# Bergen node

The Bergen node, **ELIXIR@UiB**, is located at the [Computational Biology Unit (CBU)](https://cbu.w.uib.no/) at the University of Bergen (UiB). CBU is an interdisciplinary research centre within the field of _bioinformatics_ and _computational biology_ and consists of groups from both natural and clinical sciences.

ELIXIR@UiB provides broad bioinformatics services, mainly for high-throughput omics data analysis. That includes high-throughput sequencing data (i.e. [Exome-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exome_sequencing), [RNA-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq) and [ChIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP_sequencing)), gene expression microarrays and quantitative proteomics datasets.

We also provide consulting on planning and design of high-throughput technology-based experiments. The biological topics in focus are based on our collaborators’ research areas and these include medical research at [Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen](https://www.helse-bergen.no/en/steder/haukeland), and [Marine Biology at the Department of Biology, UiB](https://www.uib.no/en/bio/160170/fisheries-and-marine-biology-group) and the [Marine Research Institute (IMR)](https://www.hi.no).

We further develop bioinformatics analysis infrastructure including e.g. [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.no/login/start) workflows as part of the [Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Science (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no/), and host the NeLS core developer team. In addition, we are collaborating with the Oslo node on the storage and analysis of sensitive data. Together we have developed the [Norwegian node of the Federated European Genome-Phenome Archive (FEGA Norway](https://ega.elixir.no/) for archiving human genomes and are now developing the [Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI)](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/) in collaboration with other European countries in the [1+Million Genome Project (1+MG)](https://framework.onemilliongenomes.eu/).

<Callout>
    For a bioinformatics support request regarding a project you are working on, please use the helpdesk e-mail
    adress: [contact@elixir.no](mailto:contact@elixir.no). That will reach a large group of bioinformaticians that
    will try to answer your request by e-mail, and if needed a local meeting can be organised.
