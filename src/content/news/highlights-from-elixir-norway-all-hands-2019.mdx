**Our annual "All Hands" meeting took place during four consecutive days
in Oslo, 22-25 October, this year with a strong flavour of data
management, thanks to our two new grants BioMedData and Converge!**

The meeting started with a satellite workshop on workflow development
and data management, before "All Hands" were gathered to present and
discuss current news, updates and challenges. The program included
talks on the ELIXIR scientific programme 2019-23, future NeLS-Galaxy
models, systems biology, MetaKube, Ensembl, federated EGA and
data management, in addition to a session addressing models for sustainable
future operation of ELIXIR Norway.

After the All Hands, a more narrow delegation met with our scientific
advisory committee and our newly engaged stakeholder panel,
representing some of our different user groups, for excellent
input, comments and advice, before the meeting was closed with
an ELixir Norway board meeting on Friday afternoon. A huge thank
you to everyone who has contributed with talks, questions, comments
and input! See you all next year.
