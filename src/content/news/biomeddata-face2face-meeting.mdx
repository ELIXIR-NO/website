**After 2 years of online meetings, the project affiliation liaisons (PALs) from the participating life-science data producing infrastructures in [BioMedData](/services/bio-med-data) finally, for the first time, met in person!**

Together with our guests from Belgium, Flora d'Anna and Rafael Buono, we discussed for 2 days on implementation of research data management best practices, training of data stewards, documentation and future events in SÃ¸rum near Oslo.

We are looking forward to the second half of the project and are more than happy that several research infrastructures have started to include data management practices and the contribution to the BioMedData network into their most recent applications and hope this trend will continue.

BioMedData will soon announce exchange opportunities for institutional and center-based Data Stewards. Stay tuned.
