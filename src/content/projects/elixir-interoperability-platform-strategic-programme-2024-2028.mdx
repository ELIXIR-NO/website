The Interoperability Platform helps people and machines discover, access, integrate and analyse biological data. It encourages the life science community to adopt standardised file formats, metadata, vocabularies and identifiers.

The Platform centres on "The 3 Ps": Products, Processes, and Practices:

**Products** entail mapping and coordinating FAIR resources, minimising duplication, and enhancing user experience.

**Processes** align products with user needs, ELIXIR Nodes, and global partners.

**Practices** convert insights into actionable guidance, empowering users through the connection and use of diverse resources.

These initiatives reinforce the Platform's dedication to interoperability, data stewardship, and efficient resource utilisation. Aligned with Open Science and FAIR principles, they cement the role of ELIXIR in the EOSC ecosystem.

The Norwegian effort is in WP2: Growing the FAIR-enabling portfolio of products. WP3: Standardising processes for FAIR data management and WP4: Establishing best practices for interoperable data management and use.
