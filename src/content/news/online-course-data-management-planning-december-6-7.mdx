**ELIXIR Norway and the Centre for Digital Life Norway is organizing a Data Management Planning workshop for Life Science Projects**

We are pleased to announce the Data Management planning workshop for Life Scientists in Norway by ELIXIR Norway and Digital Life Norway.

All projects that receive funding from the Norwegian RCN are required to submit a data management plan as soon as possible after the contract with the RCN has been signed. All Norwegian universities now also require a DMP for all projects. This workshop focuses on how-to generate a data management plan for a Life Science research project that will meet the requirements of the RCN.

We would like to invite researchers (PhD candidates, Post Doctoral Fellows, Researchers, Associate Professors and Professors) in existing and upcoming Life Science projects to develop their DMP in this workshop. Maximum number of participants: 45
