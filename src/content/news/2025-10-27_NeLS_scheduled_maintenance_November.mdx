The Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Science (NeLS) is ELIXIR Norway's main services for researchers to manage their life science data, and is a core system we are continuosly working to enhance and improve.

Scheduled Maintenance Downtime : We will upgrade our front-end services in NeLS on November 4th (from 0800) and 5th (until 2000), and your friendly NeLS services will after that be available on the URL https://nels.elixir.no instead of https://nels.bioinfo.no.

If you use SSH to connect to NeLS, please note that new and stronger key encryption is utilized and you will need to fetch your new keys with updated connection instructions under "My Profile" after the upgrade.
