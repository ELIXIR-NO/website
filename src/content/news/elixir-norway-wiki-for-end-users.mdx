**ELIXIR Norway has made a wiki with documentation on how to use
the different parts of our infrastructure**

ELIXIR Norway provide services and training for supporting life
science research to efficiently and safely store, share, analyse
and publish their data. We have now published a wiki with documentation
for the use of the different parts of our infrastructure.

Please have a look [here](https://nels-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you have any feedback on the content, or if you wish
to see documentation on other parts of what we provide,
please contact the [ELIXIR Norway support desk](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no)
