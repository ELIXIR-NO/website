**ELIXIR Norway now invites groups at the five partner institutions
(UiB, UiT, NTNU, UiO and NMBU) to propose their bioinformatics tools
and resources to be included as ELIXIR services.**

ELIXIR and ELIXIR Norway provide resources including databases, analysis
tools, and training as well as services to enable interoperability,
reproducible research, and e-infrastructure. The service portfolio
of ELIXIR is the sum of all services provided by the national Nodes.

Having your service included as an ELIXIR service will increase its
visibility and integration with ELIXIR, and may also increase the
number of users. All types of bioinformatics resources accelerating
research in life-science are eligible (databases, data resources,
tools, workflows, web services, training activities) provided they
are open to external users (commercial resources not eligible).

The services provided by ELIXIR Norway are twofold. Services at the national
Node level are serving the Norwegian scientific community, while ELIXIR Norway
Selected Node Services become part of the ELIXIR (international) service
portfolio that serves the international scientific community.

Submitted applications will be assessed by the ELIXIR Norway Scientific
Advisory Board (SAB) and selected in consultation with the ELIXIR Norway
Node leader group. The applications can be assessed for status as Norway
Node Services or Selected Node Services, depending on the level of maturity
of the proposed service.

A more formal description of the application procedure is provided
in the application form [**here**](http://bit.ly/ApplicationServices2020).
Applications can be sent by email to ELIXIR Norwayâ€™s Node
Coordinator ([Christine.Stansberg@uib.no](mailto:Christine.Stansberg@uib.no)).
Questions about the process and proposals can also be sent to the same address.

Application form can be downloaded from **[here](http://bit.ly/ApplicationServices2020)**.

Call closes**15 December 2020**.

## Timeline

- Deadline for submission: **15 December 2020**
