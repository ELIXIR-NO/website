This project targets the ELIXIR-GOBLET instructor community and trainers, who are typically domain experts in ELIXIR platforms, communities, and services. By providing these experts with the skills and knowledge needed to effectively use ELIXIR’s training resources and services, the project ensures high-quality training design, development, and delivery for the research community.

The goals of the project include sustaining and further developing the ELIXIR-GOBLET Train-the-Trainer (TtT) instructor community (WP2), establishing a mentorship program for trainers (WP4), and creating new training modules that can either complement the TtT program or be delivered independently by ELIXIR members (WP3). Ultimately, this project aims to strengthen the ELIXIR community’s capacity in essential training skills.

Eleven ELIXIR Nodes are participating in the present study. For ELIXIR Belgium, Alex Botzki and Bruna Piereck are involved in WP3.
