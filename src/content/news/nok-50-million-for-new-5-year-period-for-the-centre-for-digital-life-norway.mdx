**The Research Council of Norway has granted the Centre for Digital Life
Norway (DLN) funding for 5 more years. The centre aims to transform
Norwegian biotechnology research to increase innovation and value
creation for society. DLN 2.0 starts in February 2021 with ELIXIR-Norway
as a partner for Research Data Management**

The Centre for Digital Life Norway (DLN)  has an ongoing collaboration with
ELIXIR Norway to provide solutions for improved data management in the
centre. This includes the use of the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for
Life Sciences (NeLS) and the FAIRdom SEEK data management platforms.
This work is conducted in close dialogue with the research projects
in the centre.

This platforms provide access to long-term storage of
scientific data, simplifies good practices for documenting metadata,
as well as easier sharing and publishing of data and models. These
solutions facilitate the FAIRification (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) principles of scientific results.

We are looking forward to continue this exciting collaboration!
