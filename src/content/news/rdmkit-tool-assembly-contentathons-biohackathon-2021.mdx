In the context of [CONVERGE](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge), ELIXIR-Norway organized two contentathon to extend the [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/) with tool assemblies - carefully curated and selected set of tools to facilitate research data management in the Life Science domains with a focus on local availability or need of a specific domain. During 4 days in May and June 2021 over 30 research data management experts from all over Europe compiled several tool assemblies for Data Stewards and Researchers.

> We hope this examples will help others to do their data management in a better and more efficient manner — Said [Korbinian Bösl](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Korbinian.Boesl), who has been organizing the contentathons.

We are super happy that the joint proposal of ELIXIR-Norway and [ELIXIR-Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/) to extend the RDMkit further has just been selected for the [Biohackathon 2021](https://biohackathon-europe.org/), and we are looking forward to meet exciting people to enable more knowledge transfer.
