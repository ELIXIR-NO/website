For ELIXIR Nodes to succeed, they must operate as well-coordinated, professionally managed organisations, delivering high-quality support, expertise, and services that align with both national stakeholders' needs and ELIXIR's broader research priorities. Achieving long-term success in a research infrastructure requires more than just funding; it demands strategic planning, strong communication, community engagement, technological innovation, skilled personnel, adaptability, and a commitment to ethical and legal standards.

This project aims to equip the Nodes with tools and knowledge to enhance the measurement of their activities and external environment, streamline efforts, and improve communication.

The tasks are carried out in 4 work packages:

- WP2: Operations in Federated Research Infrastructures
- WP3: Improving preparedness for funding applications
- WP4: Alignment with national Open Science plans and national research policies
- WP5: Industry engagement

The present study is participated in by sixteen ELIXIR Nodes. For ELIXIR Belgium, Kim De Ruyck is involved in WP4.
