The Genome of Europe initiative aims to build a European network of national genomic reference cohorts of at least 500,000 citizens. These reference cohorts will be selected to be representative of the European population.

To achieve this, each country involved will establish a population cohort that reflects the genetic composition of its population, including both healthy and diseased individuals. The country will then connect this data into a European cohort, thus establishing a collective European reference dataset.

The 500,000 sequenced genomes collected will contribute to the million genomes aimed for in the 1+MG initiative.
