PDN is a global consortium aiming to enable a world-wide ecosystem of linked data and tools to support research and public health response to infectious diseases and epidemics. It will cover diverse biodata types, including host and pathogen genomics, transcriptomics, proteins, pathways and networks, imaging and cohorts. Coordinated by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and bringing together 12 international partners, this project is funded under the NIHâ€™s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Bioinformatics Resource Program (NIH NIAID BRC, award number U24AI183840).
