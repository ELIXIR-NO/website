## Introduction

immuneML is a machine learning framework to predict adaptive immune response and disease, as initially described in Pavlovic et al. immuneML is a platform for machine learning-based analysis and classification of adaptive immune receptors and repertoires (AIRR). ImmuneML can be used in training machine learning models for repertoire classification (e.g., disease prediction) or receptor sequence classification (e.g., antigen binding prediction), and applying them to new datasets with unknown class labels. It can also be used for simulating datasets for machine learning model benchmarking, perform exploratory analysis of datasets such as statistical analyses, dimensionality reduction or clustering in order to gain deeper insight into the data.

## About this service

immuneML is a powerful platform developed by ELIXIR Norway for the machine learning-based analysis and classification of adaptive immune receptors and repertoires (AIRR). This service allows researchers to train machine learning models for repertoire classification, such as disease prediction, and receptor sequence classification, like antigen binding prediction. It also supports the simulation of datasets for benchmarking machine learning models and performing exploratory analyses, including statistical analyses, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, to gain deeper insights into the data.

## Why use this service

immuneML is invaluable for immunologists, bioinformaticians, and data scientists focused on understanding and predicting immune responses. By leveraging machine learning, it provides sophisticated tools to analyze complex immune data, facilitating advancements in immunotherapy, vaccine development, and disease diagnostics. The platformâ€™s comprehensive capabilities and user-friendly design make it an essential resource for cutting-edge immune research.
