# How to get help

Contact us at [support@elixir.no](mailto:support@elixir.no)

<Callout title="How it works?" variant="info">When a request is submitted, it is broadcast to all members of the
    Helpdesk. The request is then picked up by the member with the most expertise on the topic. We typically reply within 1 working day </Callout>

# Usage instructions

ELIXIR Norway also hosts a documentation for our infrastructure, available [here](https://nels-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Support model

Projects that can be solved within a working day are free of charge (enabled by funding from the Research Council of Norway). 
For more demanding projects, an hourly rate applies, and you will have to **enter an agreement with ELIXIR Norway**.

Projects that require an effort beyond technical assistance/consultancy may be set up as a research collaboration, e.g. by providing funding for a percentage of the position of a helpdesk member.

<Card title="The Service Agreement">
    For requests that require platform contribution for more than a working day, an agreement
    between the client and the platform must be made. The agreement should cover the type and cost of the service. If
    applicable, the agreement should also cover a plan for _publication_ and _co-authorship_. Regardless of the type of
    contribution the platform has given to a project, we expect to be included in the **acknowledgements** of resulting
    publications or other relevant outputs.
