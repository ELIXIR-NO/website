**We have good news to all users of NeLS Galaxy**

The existing five national NeLS Galaxy instances will be replaced by one common national NeLS Galaxy instance called usegalaxy.no. Feedback from several of our Galaxy users was important for this decision. By doing so, the users will have easy access to a more comprehensive set of tools than in the existing individual Galaxies.

The migration will take place in October 2020. You are therefore asked to start the preparation of removing data that is no longer needed and moving data you want to keep.

All existing NeLS Galaxy users should have received an email with instructions how to start to prepare for the migration. If you have questions regarding the migration, please contact the [Norwegian ELIXIR helpdesk](mailto:contact@bioinfo.no)
