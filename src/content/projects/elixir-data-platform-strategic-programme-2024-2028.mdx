# Platform highlights:
* ELIXIR Core Data Resources: European data resources that are of fundamental importance to research in the life sciences and are committed to the long-term preservation of data.
* ELIXIR Deposition Databases: repositories recommended for the deposition of life sciences experimental data.
* Data resource services: this list is updated as Nodes finalise or review their Service Delivery Plans.

The project is organised into five Work Packages:

* WP1: Management and coordination 
* WP2: Connecting and brokering Node contributions to ELIXIR data resources
* WP3: Recognition and credit attribution of research contributions to data resources
* WP4: Scalable curation support from the long tail of biological data
* WP5: Establishing and shaping the landscape of Core and Community biological databases

ELIXIR Norway is participating in WP2, helping in connecting ELIXIR data resources with data contributors in the various ELIXIR nodes in addition to establishing best practices and training paths in the field.
