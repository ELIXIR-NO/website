ELIXIR-CONVERGE is a project funded by the European Commission to help standardise life science data management across Europe. To achieve this standardisation, the project will **develop a data management toolkit for life scientists**. The toolkit will help ensure more research data is in the public domain, which will give scientists access to more data. This will allow them to discover new insights into the challenges facing society, such as food security and health in old age, and help stimulate innovation in biomedicine and biotechnology.

The initial operational phase of ELIXIR, supported by the H2020 ELIXIR-EXCELERATE project (2015-19), focussed on the coordination and delivery of bioinformatics services from national Nodes. This laid the foundation for a coordinated European life science infrastructure. **ELIXIR-CONVERGE** will build on these achievements to deliver another critical component: **the provisioning, across Europe, of distributed local support for data management**. This will be based on a toolkit for researchers that enables lifecycle management for their research data, in compliance with international standards.

ELIXIR-CONVERGE will develop the national operations of the research infrastructure to drive good data management, reproducibility and reuse. Over 36 months and with partners from all 23 Nodes, ELIXIR-CONVERGE takes the next step to create a European data federation where interconnected national operations allow users to extract knowledge from life scienceâ€™s large, diverse and distributed datasets.

By connecting ELIXIR Nodes to provide FAIR data management as a service, ELIXIR-CONVERGE will build national capacity and create a blueprint for operating sustainable Nodes in distributed research infrastructures. [Read more](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge).
