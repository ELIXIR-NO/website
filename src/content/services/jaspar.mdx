## Introduction

[JASPAR](https://jaspar.elixir.no/) is an open access database of manually curated non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles. The JASPAR core database contains a curated, non-redundant set of profiles, derived from published collections of experimentally defined transcription factor binding sites for eukaryotes. The prime difference to similar resources (TRANSFAC, etc.) consist of the open data access, non-redundancy and quality. This database is especially helpful when you seek models for specific factors or structural classes, or if experimental evidence is paramount. Search directly for organism, gene or protein, browse in 6 taxonomic groups or participate in the Q and A forum directly from the JASPAR website. You can also access the JASPAR database programmatically with RESTful API or run the phytonic interface pyJASPAR.

## About this service

JASPAR, supported by ELIXIR Norway, is a comprehensive database of manually curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles. The core database includes experimentally defined binding sites, offering models for specific factors or structural classes. Unlike similar resources, JASPAR provides open data access and high-quality, non-redundant profiles, making it a valuable tool for researchers studying gene regulation and transcription factor interactions.

## Why use this service

JASPAR is ideal for geneticists, molecular biologists, and bioinformaticians requiring accurate TF binding profiles. The database supports various research needs, from identifying binding sites to understanding gene regulation mechanisms. Its open access and extensive data make it a preferred choice for researchers seeking reliable and high-quality TF binding information.

## How to get started

Researchers can access JASPAR through its website to search for TF binding profiles, browse taxonomic groups, or use the RESTful API for programmatic access. Visit JASPAR to start exploring its resources and integrating TF data into your research.
