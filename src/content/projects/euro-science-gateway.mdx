EuroScienceGateway leverages a distributed computing network across 13 European countries, accessible via 6 national web portals based on the [Galaxy analysis framework](https://galaxyproject.org/). 

This provides access to compute and storage infrastructures, as well as to data, tools, workflows and services across Europe.

EuroScienceGateway delivers a robust, scalable, seamlessly integrated open infrastructure for data-driven research, contributing an innovative and customisable service for EOSC that enables operational open and FAIR data and data processing, empowering European researchers to embrace the new digital age of science.
