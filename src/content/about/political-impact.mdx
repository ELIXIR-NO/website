title: "ELIXIR Norway’s Role in Personalised Medicine and Genomic Data Sharing"
---

ELIXIR Norway is recognised in [Norway’s national strategy for personalised medicine (2023–2030)](https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/c0ab0380265445e58508c36e51e5561b/no/pdfs/strategi-for-persontilpasset-medisin.pdf) as a key partner in the European [1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes), aiming to contribute around 7,800 representative Norwegian genomes to the Genome of Europe. 
As one of five leading national ELIXIR Nodes in Europe, ELIXIR Norway has secured significant funding through the Genome Data Infrastructure (GDI, https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/) project to develop infrastructure for sharing genomic data across Europe.
In addition, the Federated EGA (FEGA) Norway platform (https://ega.elixir.no/) is a central solution for secure archiving and controlled access to sensitive human data — balancing open science with privacy laws. 
ELIXIR Norway’s infrastructure supports major projects like InPreD (https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/avdelinger/klinikk-for-laboratoriemedisin/avdeling-for-patologi/seksjon-for-utprovende-diagnostikk-og-forskningsstotte/utprovende-diagnostikk-og-forskningsstotte/nasjonal-infrastruktur-for-presisjonsdiagnostikk-kreft/), IMPRESS (https://impress-norway.no/), NORMENT, and collaborations with Biobank Norway (BBN, https://bbmri.no/) and the three trusted research environments in Norway; HuntCloud (https://about.hdc.ntnu.no/), SAFE (https://www.uib.no/safe) and TSD (https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/sensitiv/).
