ELIXIR has announced the life science data resources selected in its latest evaluation round for ELIXIR Core Data Resources (CDRs) and ELIXIR Deposition Databases. Among the six newly approved Core Data Resources is JASPAR, a long-standing and widely used database for transcription factor binding profiles, with the work behind the resource currently led by Anthony Mathelier, Associate Director and Group Leader of the Computational Biology & Gene Regulation group at the Norwegian Centre for Molecular Biosciences and Medicine (NCMBM) at the University of Oslo, Norway.

The ELIXIR CDR designation is awarded to Europe’s most important life science data services. These resources are recognised for their scientific excellence, their central role in biological and biomedical research, and their commitment to long-term data preservation and accessibility. Together with ELIXIR Deposition Databases and Recommended Interoperability Resources, CDRs form a trusted ecosystem that improves visibility and sustainability of data resources while providing clarity for researchers, journals, and research funders.
