The overall goal of this project is to provide secure, standardised, documented and interoperable services under the framework of the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). The three-year plan included a structured roadmap for ELIXIR Nodes to join the EGA federated network by providing the necessary technical, logistical, and training coordination across the network.
ELIXIR Norway contributes to WP3 *Coordination of interface implementation*  and WP4 *Coordination of operational nodes* as part of the federated services through Eivind Hovig, Finn Drabl√∏s, and Kjell Petersen
