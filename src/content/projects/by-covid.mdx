Intro: Covid-19 EU Project for Pandemic Preparedness

BY-COVID: Tackling Data Challenges for Effective Pandemic Response

ELIXIR leads the €12 million Horizon Europe project, BeYond-COVID (BY-COVID), dedicated to addressing data challenges that impede effective pandemic responses. The project’s primary goal is to make data on SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases accessible to researchers, healthcare professionals and industry stakeholders.

Building on the success of the COVID-19 Data Platform, initiated early in the pandemic by ELIXIR and EMBL-EBI, BY-COVID aims to extend and enhance existing informatics infrastructure. The project integrates tools and operational frameworks from the EMBL-EBI and COMPARE projects into the COVID-19 Data Portal and SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs, facilitating comprehensive data access and analysis.

BY-COVID’s interdisciplinary approach involves 53 partners from 19 European countries, combining expertise in life sciences, policy, and social sciences. Collaborations with organizations like the Versatile emerging infectious disease Observatory (VEO) and the Public Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) ensure a wide-ranging integration of public health and social science data.

ELIXIR Norway contributes significantly to BY-COVID. The University of Tromsø focuses on support for virological analyses in emerging outbreaks, while the University of Oslo Centre for Information Technology (USIT) facilitates secondary use of COVID-19 vaccine trial data to test existing vaccines against new variants using TSD as the data repository.

Other key work packages include:

- WP2: Accessing heterogeneous data across domains and jurisdictions
- WP3: Developing a COVID-19 integration platform
- WP4: Connecting the COVID-19 platform to analysis tools and local portals
- WP5: Creating a continuously evolving demonstrator project
- WP6: Engaging, training, and building capacity with stakeholders
- WP7: Outreach, communication, industry, and public engagement
- WP8: Coordination, project management, and addressing ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI)
