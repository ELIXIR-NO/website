The technical work package of ELIXIR Norway (WP2) had its yearly face-to-face meeting on 16-17 Sept 2024 in Trondheim.

The event is a yearly meet-up to foster collaboration and teamwork. Eleven professionals attended the session physically while two joined virtually this year.
This year's event was in Trondheim and was a very successful event learning from the previous year's experience.

A group dinner at [Gubalari](https://gubalari.no/) provided the necessary break from the intense technical work of the day and a great team-building opportunity.
