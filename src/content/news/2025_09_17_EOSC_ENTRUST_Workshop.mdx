---
Pål Sætrom [(ELIXIR-NTNU)](../about/trondheim/) and Miikka Kallberg ([ELIXIR-CSC](https://csc.fi/en/researchinfrastructure/elixir/)) co-led the 2nd Evaluation and Adoption Workshop, dedicated to advancing the architecture of the TRE Blueprint.
The event brought together approximately 30 stakeholders from across the work packages—encompassing providers, drivers, workflows, AAAI, and the architecture group—who gathered to explore ways to strengthen the network of Trusted Research Environments (TREs) across Europe and beyond.
Discussions on interoperability, legal frameworks, and federation models underscored both the significant challenges ahead and the promising opportunities for deeper collaboration.
Ingeborg Winge ([ELIXIR-UiB](../about/bergen/)), Christine Stansberg ([SAFE-UiB](https://www.uib.no/en/safe)) and Stefanie Kirschenmann (ELIXIR-CSC) were also part of the organising team.
