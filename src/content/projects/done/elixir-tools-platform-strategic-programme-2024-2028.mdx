title: "ELIXIR Tools Platform in the ELIXIR Strategic Programme 2024-2028"
summary: ""
status: "ongoing"
period: "1 January 2024 - 31 December 2026"
---

The Tools Platform provides services that enable findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of computational tools, including research software, workflows, remote digital services, and trained machine-learning models. These services aim at being optimised for the needs of molecular life sciences, while at the same time they suit a broad range of interdisciplinary applications and scientific communities.

The objectives of the Tools Platform are threefold. First, it strives to offer researchers well-described and fit-for-purpose software that can be used in heterogeneous computing setups, from a laptop to a cloud installation to an HPC centre. Second, the Platform aims to be a reference point for individual research software engineers on how to develop better, more sustainable, and recognizable software by providing best practices. Third, scientific communities can use the Platform as a place to address common challenges for software development.


The Platform will deliver this work through 4 work packages:

WP2: The ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem
WP3: Software Management, Stewardship and Standards
WP4: Improving Software Quality for reproducible and distributed analysis
WP5: Democratised access to reusable complex workflows

This study features the participation of the ELIXIR Hub and fifteen ELIXIR Nodes: ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Spain, ELIXIR France, ELIXIR Belgium (Rafael Andrade Buono), ELIXIR Czech Republic, ELIXIR Switzerland, ELIXIR Denmark, EMBL-EBI, ELIXIR Estonia, ELIXIR Greece, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR Netherlands, ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Sweden, and ELIXIR United Kingdom.
