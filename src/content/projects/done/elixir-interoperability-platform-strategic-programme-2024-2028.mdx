The Interoperability Platform's mission goes beyond technical and semantic interoperability, responding to changing needs and life sciences standards. Previously, the ELIXIR Interoperability Platform introduced peer-reviewed Recommended Interoperability Resources, established the ELIXIR Knowledge Hub, and fostered recognition of Research Data Management (RDM). Now it is transitioning to a sustainable framework for enabling real-world data integration and reuse by promoting and supporting interoperability, data management and FAIR principles.

The strategy of this project centres around products, processes, and practices. Products entail mapping and coordinating FAIR resources, minimising duplication, and enhancing user experience. Processes align products with user needs, ELIXIR Nodes, and global partners. Practices convert insights into actionable guidance, empowering users through the connection and use of diverse resources. These initiatives reinforce the Platform's dedication to interoperability, data stewardship, and efficient resource utilisation. Aligned with Open Science and FAIR principles, they cement the role of ELIXIR in the EOSC ecosystem.

The tasks in this project are carried out in 3 work packages:

- WP2: Growing the FAIR-enabling portfolio of products
- WP3: Standardising processes for FAIR data management
- WP4: Establishing best practices for interoperable data management and use

This study features the participation of the ELIXIR Hub and thirteen ELIXIR Nodes: ELIXIR Netherlands, ELIXIR United Kingdom, ELIXIR Belgium (Flora Dâ€™Anna, Bert Droesbeke), ELIXIR Switzerland (SIB), ELIXIR Czech Republic, EMBL-EBI, ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Spain,, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR Luxembourg, ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Sweden, and ELIXIR Slovenia.
