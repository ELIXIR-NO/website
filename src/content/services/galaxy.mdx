## Introduction

Galaxy is an open, web-based analysis platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational life science research. The usegalaxy.no platform offers DIY bioinformatics analysis with pre-made workflows and almost 2000 tools available.‚ÄùThe Galaxy data analysis platform is maintained by ELIXIR Norway, to support  life science professionals across industry and academia. Research in Galaxy is supported by 3 pillars: data, tools, and workflows. Import and modify your data, run tools to process and visualize data without concern of processing power and recreate analyses with galaxy workflows. By utilising our infrastructure, your research will be less impacted by lack of computer processing power or reproducability in workflows. Data analysis performed in usegalaxy.no together with the results from the analysis can easily be shared with collaborators.
