The ELIXIR Compute Platform ensures that European cloud, compute, storage and access services fulfil the requirements of and are available for the life-science research community. European regulation on health data processing is evolving, computing capacity in national clouds is increasing and international standards are improving interoperability between the compute environments. Such capabilities are also increasingly important to service the growing volumes of biodiversity, food security and pathogen data which comprise complex data types and must be linked to climate data resources. Also, supercomputer investments - especially EuroHPC - provide completely new kinds of computing capacities for researchers across these domains.

All this shapes the landscape of European compute resources. Especially computing on sensitive data near the data resources is becoming obligatory but the same is true for non-sensitive data such as plant phenotyping data and associated imaging data. In 2024-2026, the Platform will build technological capability to enable compute in new European-wide federated and multi-cloud settings by building on existing development and utilising previous work, especially Life Science Login. Beyond this, the Platform actively seeks sustainable ways to operate the developed services for European researchers.

The Platform will deliver the services to support federated data management and analytics in life science through 4 work packages:

- WP2: Advanced Service Access Control
- WP3: Protected Access to Sensitive Data for Analysis
- WP4: Multi Cloud Infrastructure Deployment
- WP5: Sustainability, Accounting and Provenance for Federated Analytics

This study features the participation of the ELIXIR Hub and twelve ELIXIR Nodes: ELIXIR Czech Republic, ELIXIR Finland, ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Belgium (Dilza Campos, Paul De Geest, Rafael Andrade Buono), ELIXIR Estonia, ELIXIR France, ELIXIR Greece, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR Luxembourg, ELIXIR Netherlands, ELIXIR Switzerland, and ELIXIR United Kingdom. Australian BioCommons is involved as an international partner.
