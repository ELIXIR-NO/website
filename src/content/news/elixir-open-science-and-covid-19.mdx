**Open data and science is key against COVID-19, have a look at the efforts
and resources provided by ELIXIR and ELIXIR Norway.**

Extraordinary global efforts are now being made on developing effective
countermeasures against COVID-19, and sharing of data and analytics is
key for a successful response. The sense of emergency painfully highlights
the importance of collaborative research and open, reproducible
science. In recognition of this, more than a hundred institutions,
companies, policy makers, funders, publishers and other agencies worldwide
have signed a statement made by the [Wellcome Trust on sharing data in
public health emergencies](https://wellcome.ac.uk/press-release/sharing-research-data-and-findings-relevant-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak),
and now affirms these in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

ELIXIR plays a central role in hosting, maintaining, coordinating and
connecting publicly funded databases and analysis tools that are now
being used in the race against COVID-19\. An overview of
[ELIXIR support for SARS-CoV-2](https://elixir-europe.org/covid-19-resources)
was just published on the ELIXIR Europe webpages, and is well worth a visit.

ELIXIR is also supporting research on COVID-19 through EOSC (European
Open Science Cloud) Life and the European Galaxy platforms. The
need for open data and open analytics in order to achieve agile and
effective responses against rapidly emerging pathogens was further
stressed in a recent [publication from Galaxy teams from the
US, Australia and ELIXIR](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.959973).
And, ELIXIR Norway contributes actively to the ELIXIR Galaxy community,
and we are ready to scale up our engagement by providing compute resources
for relevant analyses made available through the
European Galaxy server.

ELIXIR Norway will further collaborate with the National Institute
of Public Health (NIPH/FHI) and other institutions that are
sequencing and analysing SARS-CoV-2 within the Norwegian population,
aiming to make data available for the research community.
ELIXIR Norway offers [support on data management](Services/data-management)
of life science data, and may assist when it comes to managing,
analyzing and sharing sequences from the current pandemic.
We may also give advice on how to re-use virus data provided by
other institutions and countries.

To help and guide researchers and other interested parties also
in Norway, we are setting up a [COVID-19 information page](corona)
on the Norwegian ELIXIR web pages. This page highlights bioinformatics
resources such as data sets and analysis methods that are relevant
to the situation.

Last, but not least, as always, our [Helpdesk](helpdesk) may assist
researchers wanting to use bioinformatics resources, who may
need support and advice on how to do this and get started.
