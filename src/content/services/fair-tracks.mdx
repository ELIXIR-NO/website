FAIRtracks is an ecosystem for gathering, curating, validating, integrating, and indexing the metadata of genomic track datasets. In the spirit of Open Science, the FAIRtracks ecosystem provides technical solutions for the abundance of genome browser track files ("genomic tracks") to become "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)" in new research contexts. This ecosystem provides support through all the data life cycle and contains materials, services, and community building towards bridging the data gaps. FAIRtracks enables the discovery of genomic datasets through indexing and search of harmonised track metadata.

## What are genomic tracks?

Genomic tracks are condensed data files which are routinely generated through standardised data processing workflows when novel genomic datasets are published.

This ecosystem aims to mobilise the power of genomic tracks by connecting data providers, biocurators, tool developers, researchers, analysts, the FAIR community and everyone else interested. FAIRtracks is provided by ELIXIR Norway and ELIXIR Spain and is endorsed by ELIXIR Europe as a Recommended Interoperability Resource (RIR)
