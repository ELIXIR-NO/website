**We are pleased to announce the first online course on using the Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Science ([NeLS](https://nels.bioinfo.no/)) and the national supported Galaxy ([usegalaxy.no](https://usegalaxy.no/)). The course will consist of lessons covering the necessary topics alternating with hands-on sessions to gain practical experience.**

The topic is on how you can use NeLS to store and share data, and to run analyses via customisable analysis workflows in [usegalaxy.no](usegalaxy.no). You will practice on transferring data between NeLS and usegalaxy.no, and to construct and run a complete sequence analysis workflow in usegalaxy.no. An overview of the event can be found at the bottom of this announcement.

There are no requirements for programming skills or experience using the command line, as Galaxy provides a web interface for running analysis.

**Time:** We will organise three identical events during spring 2021 - see registration below
**Place:** Online
**Duration:** 09.00 - 16.00
**Prerequisites:** FEIDE login credentials or NeLS idp ([apply for NeLS idp](https://nels.bioinfo.no/idp/module.php/core/loginuserpass.php?AuthState=_ce9a4e6d60deb6c2e0b8c13b1cf3b865d45748336a%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fnels.bioinfo.no%2Fidp%2Fsaml2%2Fidp%2FSSOService.php%3Fspentityid%3Durn%253Amace%253Afeide.no%253Aservices%253Ano.bioinfo.nels%26cookieTime%3D1614670990)) and a computer you have permissions to install software on
