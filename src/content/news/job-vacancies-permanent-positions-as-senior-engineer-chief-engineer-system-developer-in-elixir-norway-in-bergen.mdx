### About the Department of Informatics

Digitization of businesses, industry, public administration, and education makes informatics play an increasingly important role in the development of society. Research and education in informatics are crucial for the digital transformation of society to succeed. If you want to be a part of an international work environment, and a contributor to leading research projects, apply for a job [at the Department of Informatics](https://www.uib.no/en/ii). The Department is in rapid growth regarding its number of students, research directions, and employees. We have today about 1000 students, and almost 40 different nationalities represented among our 150 employees.

These positions will be a part of our technical team at [Computational Biology Unit (CBU)](https://cbu.uib.no/), which is the research center for computational biology and bioinformatics at University of Bergen. CBU coordinates ELIXIR Norway, the Norwegian node of the pan-European ELIXIR infrastructure (an ESFRI landmark) for life science data.

At the Department of Informatics there is a vacancy for up to two positions as senior egngineers, funded by external projects.

One central project focuses on secure archiving and controlled access to human genome datasets and related information in a federated solution.

- Master's in computer science or equivalent is required. Long relevant practical experience from software and system development, may compensate for not meeting the formal education requirements.
- Experience from both Python and Java development is required, with in depth experience from one of these languages, including familiarity with micro service based system architecture. Experience also from Go (Golang) will be regarded as very beneficial.
- Good experience with version control systems like git is a requirement, as well as knowledge on agile/iterative software development methodology.

- Our system platform is Linux, with extensive use of virtualization technology. Solid knowledge within both of these areas is desirable but not required.
- Working experience with containers, such as Docker (building and management) is strongly desirable.
- Experience from development of distributed systems and relevant technologies is advantageous (i.e. message queueing)
- Previous work experience from a geographically distributed software development team, in a multi-cultural environment, are both desirable.
- As we develop e-infrastructure services for the life sciences, basic knowledge within molecular biology/biomedicine would be a plus, but not a requirement

### Personal qualities are important, and will be emphasized:

- Applicants must have excellent skills in oral and written English.
- A high level of independence and integrity is required.
- We expect enthusiasm and the ability to perform well in a cross-disciplinary team.
- As an employee in a research and teaching institution you must be willing and capable of learning new things as required to solve tasks
