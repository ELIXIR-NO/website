Join us for a one-day event in central Oslo connecting the aquaculture industry with leading European infrastructures like ELIXIR and EuroFAANG. 

As aquaculture scales to meet global food demands, the ability to harness genomic and functional data is becoming critical for improving sustainability, productivity, and genetic gain. Yet, much of this valuable data remains underused. This event aims to bridge that gap by showcasing how European research infrastructures are making data more accessible and actionable. 
The program contains a mix of expert talks, interactive demonstrations, and open discussions focused on real-world applications, emerging tools, and cross-sector collaboration. Whether you are in research, breeding, or innovation strategy, this is your chance to engage with major projects shaping the future of aquaculture.

This workshop is funded by ELXIR Europe and the Norwegian Research Council.
