**ELIXIR Norway has successfully migrated the five NeLS Galaxy instances into one Norwegian usegalaxy**

The service is fully operational and can be accessed via FEIDE login credentials. We currently provide almost 2000 tools, and we are implementing multiple analysis workflows for life science data. We offer each user 200 GB of personal storage. [usegalaxy.no](usegalaxy.no) is connected to the NeLS storage, and we encourage users to transfer and store data there.
