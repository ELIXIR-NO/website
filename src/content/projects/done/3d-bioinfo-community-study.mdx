The structural Bioinformatics Community (3D-BioInfo) has the mission to better integrate protein structure-based data and tools across Europe, and to improve standardisation through better ontologies and agreed benchmarking. The ties with the structural biology research communities in Europe will be strengthened and dedicated training and outreach efforts will be taken. Four major topics form the basis of this study:

- WP1: Infrastructure for FAIR structural and functional annotations
- WP2: Standards and workflows for annotating and characterising biologically meaningful 3D structures of macromolecular assemblies
- WP3: Biomacromolecule-ligand interactions
- WP4: Tools to build and analyse Nucleic Acid structures: interoperability and FAIR data

Fourteen ELIXIR Nodes are involved in this study: ELIXIR UK, ELIXIR Czech, EMBL-EBI, ELIXIR Belgium (Shoshana Wodak, Wim Vranken), ELIXIR Swiss, ELIXIR Spain, ELIXIR the Netherlands, ELIXIR France, ELIXIR Israel, ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Denmark, ELIXIR Italy, ELIXIR Sweden, and ELIXIR Slovenia.
