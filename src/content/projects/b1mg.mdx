title: "Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG)"
summary: "The 'Beyond 1 Million Genomes' (B1MG) project aims to create a robust network for genetic and clinical data sharing across Europe. Coordinated to support the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, this project is a collaboration of 23 European countries to provide cross-border access to one million sequenced genomes by 2022. ELIXIR Norway plays a crucial role in this initiative, contributing expertise and infrastructure to ensure secure, federated access to genomic data for research and clinical use."

The “Beyond 1 Million Genomes” (B1MG) project is an ambitious EU initiative designed to facilitate the sharing of human health data across Europe. This project underpins the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative, a commitment from 23 European countries to provide access to one million sequenced genomes by 2022. By creating the necessary infrastructure, legal frameworks, and best practices, B1MG ensures that scientists and clinicians can study and utilize genotypic and phenotypic data effectively.

Key contributions of the B1MG project include the development of the European Genome Dashboard, which visualizes genomic datasets and metadata collected across Europe. This infrastructure not only supports current genomic research but also sets the foundation for future data-sharing endeavours beyond the lifetime of the 1+MG Initiative (source: B1MG project website)

ELIXIR Norway is deeply involved in the B1MG project, focusing on building and maintaining the technical infrastructure necessary for secure, federated access to genomic data. The involvement of Norwegian scientists and analysts is pivotal in advancing personalized medicine, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and targeted treatments based on individual genetic profiles. This initiative is expected to significantly boost healthcare innovation and improve the quality of life for European citizens by enabling more precise preventative medicine.
