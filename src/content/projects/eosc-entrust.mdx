EOSC-ENTRUST brings together providers of operational TREs from 15 European countries with a shared goal to implement, validate and promote their capabilities through a common European framework using shared standards and common legal, operational and technical language.
This blueprint for interoperability is anchored in the EOSC Interoperability Framework spanning the four dimensions of legal, organisational, technical and semantic interoperability.
EOSC-ENTRUST has identified four driver projects covering genomics, clinical trials, social science and public-private partnerships to benchmark capabilities, inform blueprint design and demonstrate secure data analysis using federated workflows.
Targeted outreach activities will expand this open network with further providers and develop policy papers and guidelines for the full range of stakeholders to create a long-term operational TRE framework within the European Open Science Cloud.

ELIXIR Norway is co-leading WP13-15 on providing a Blueprint for Trusted Research Environments (TREs) in collaboration with [CSC (Finland)](https://csc.fi/en/) and the Norwegian TREs [TSD, UiO](https://www.uio.no/tjenester/it/forskning/sensitiv/), [HuntCloud, NTNU](https://about.hdc.ntnu.no/) and [SAFE, UiB](https://www.uib.no/safe)
