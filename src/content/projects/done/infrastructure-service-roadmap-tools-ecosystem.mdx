The ELIXIR Tools Platform Ecosystem, initiated by the ELIXIR Tools Platform, is a diverse and open initiative focused on the metadata exchange across registries and repositories. Its goal is to facilitate coordination among them, enhance interoperability, reduce mismatching information, promote good practices for resources enabling community curation and contribute towards the sustainability of each of its components over time. Hence, this project seeks to sustain and support this “Ecosystem” through three complimentary work packages:

- WP1 - Governance model, community engagement, and project management: aims to act as a proxy for the different processes to facilitate the formal engagement of services and platforms, as well as foster community engagement through the adoption of community-agreed standards to enhance sustainability over time.
- WP2 - Development of the Tools Ecosystem: further automate and consolidate the emerging Tools Ecosystem infrastructure.
- WP3 - Inclusion of new services in the Ecosystem: handle the inclusion of external resources (e.g. Galaxy, Bioconda, GitHub) and demonstrate the added value of this infrastructure.

This study features the participation of the ELIXIR Hub and ten ELIXIR Nodes: ELIXIR France, ELIXIR Norway, ELIXIR Germany, ELIXIR Denmark, ELIXIR Spain, EMBL-EBI, ELIXIR UK, ELIXIR Belgium (Frederik Coppens), ELIXIR Estonia, ELIXIR Italy.
